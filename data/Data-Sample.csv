1,"Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks is the audience: once delighted, now disintegrating","
Tasha Robinson
",2017-05-31,"      And never more so than in Showtimeâ€™s new series revival Some spoilers ahead through episode 4 of season 3 of Twin Peaks. On May 21st, Showtime brought back David Lynchâ€™s groundbreaking TV series Twin Peaks, and fulfilled a prophecy in the process. In the second season finale, back in 1991, the spirit of series-defining murder victim Laura Palmer told FBI special agent and series protagonist Dale Cooper, â€œIâ€™ll see you again in 25 years.â€� That clip plays again in the first episode of Lynchâ€™s Twin Peaks revival, as a reminder that decades have in fact gone by, Lauraâ€™s promise has been carried out, and a series canceled mid-story is back on the air.A lot has changed in 25 years. The original cast members, who are mostly back on board, have all aged heavily and visibly. Many of the characters have moved on in life, getting new jobs, forming families, or taking up new obsessions. But in the opening episode, Dale Cooper was still where the show left him in 1991: trapped in the spirit domain known as the Black Lodge, at the mercy of incomprehensible forces that behave in erratic, alien ways. In other words, heâ€™s just like anyone whoâ€™s actually watching Twin Peaks. As the third season began, the audience was also stuck back in 1991, waiting to see whether we were going to move on from the showâ€™s many long-gestating cliffhangers. And we were also at the mercy of the incomprehensible force that is David Lynch, with his erratic, alien storytelling methods.All protagonists are mediators who help tell audiences how to interpret the narrative around them, but Dale Cooper is something else entirely: he is the audience, stumbling through Lynchâ€™s obscure vision, and mutating along with it. The showâ€™s tone, budget, and format have all changed with the 2017 revival, and Cooper, too, has changed â€” more so than any other character on the show. But heâ€™s changed in ways we should recognize. Theyâ€™re the same ways weâ€™ve changed, as Twin Peaks has progressed from era-defining hit to weird cable art-experiment. The old series followed Agent Cooper through the painful, awkward process of maturing as an agent and a man. And his development happened in parallel with the maturing of a TV audience that had to learn how to follow a new kind of story.All protagonists mediate their stories, but Dale Cooper is something else entirelyToday, viewers have more sophisticated expectations than they did in the 1990s. They expect long arcs, slow character development, and mysteries that may take hours of air time to explore, let alone to decode. But Showtimeâ€™s new series is still leaving viewers curious, frustrated, baffled, and without the tools to translate what theyâ€™re seeing â€” which is exactly what Agent Cooper seems to be feeling right now as well. Consider Cooper as he started Twin Peaks back in 1990, as a fresh-faced, perky outsider walking into a mid-sized mountain community with no idea what to expect. Like the audience, he was entranced by the town of Twin Peaks â€” its quirky people, its unexpected pleasures, the sheer vividness of everything around him. Yes, he was there to solve a murder, but he was endlessly confident about his ability to tackle any case. The audience felt the same natural confidence. We knew how TV murder mysteries went. We thought we knew exactly what to expect from that end of the story: some procedural details, some red herrings, some drama, and eventually a solution.                Image: ABC  But like Cooper, we were seduced and distracted by Twin Peaksâ€™ unexpected pleasures, the way the town unfolded on-screen, with all its strange domestic soap opera dramas and oddball interactions. Like Coop, we found our fun in the unusual texture and color of the world David Lynch and Mark Frost built. In those early days, Twin Peaks was a popular fad â€” the two-hour pilot was the seasonâ€™s highest-rated TV movie â€” and the popular way to appreciate it was by emulating Dale Cooperâ€™s experience as much as possible. Lifestyle pieces proliferated in the media, tracking people who threw Peaks parties to watch the show while eating all the things Cooper rhapsodized about in the early episodes: stacks of doughnuts, cherry pie, coffee, and breakfast food. (â€œNothing beats the taste sensation when maple syrup collides with ham!â€� he chirps in episode 4.) The audience didnâ€™t just want to watch Cooper solving a mystery, they wanted to be him, experiencing his outsized cheer for the world.The audience didnâ€™t just want to watch Cooper solving a mystery, they wanted to be himAs the story went on, though, the tone darkened. Cooper lost his Boy Scout enthusiasm for food and the smell of Douglas firs. As more details emerged in the Laura Palmer murder case, another victim surfaced, and the supernatural side of the story emerged, Twin Peaks stopped sending Cooper on wacky cosplay adventures to Canada, and letting him vet his clues with oddball psychic experiments. It started confronting him with unexpected, alarming experiences. He took the first one in stride: visiting the Black Lodge in a dream, he returned convinced that heâ€™d solved the murder, and that all would be well once he remembered the solution. Like us, he didnâ€™t really understand what was going on at that point of the story, but he was still optimistic, and still willing to roll with every strange new revelation. Then Cooper got shot. The second season of Twin Peaks opened with him bleeding on the ground, enduring the unhelpful attentions of â€œthe worldâ€™s oldest waiter,â€� listening to a glowing giant who dispenses information without acknowledging that Cooper may not live to use it, and having a strained one-way conversation with his voice-activated tape recorder. The viewers suffered along with him, through excruciating events that seemed drawn out to the point of perversity. Suddenly, being Agent Dale Cooper wasnâ€™t fun anymore. His confidence was punctured, and we were all baffled and helpless together.                Image: ABC  There are moments in season 2 where Cooper bounces back into form, but theyâ€™re outnumbered by events that exhaust and chasten him, visibly transforming him into a more solemn, internal man. Jean Renault held him hostage, beat him, and threatened to murder him, suggesting Cooper was the cause of the townâ€™s growing darkness. His former FBI partner Windom Earle brought a new chaos to town, and revealed Cooperâ€™s past failings. Cooper lost his FBI standing and his love interest. He saw Earleâ€™s soul consumed in front of him. A murderous monster took his place in the outside world. By the time season 2 ended, the audience had seen Cooper frightened, powerless, and confused as much as it ever saw him confident and in control. He stopped being a motive force in the world, and became a passive object in his own story. The seriesâ€™s cancellation left viewers just as rudderless and abandoned as he was.â€˜Twin Peaksâ€™ was about a hero maturing, but also about how the world consumed and broke himCooperâ€™s trend toward impotence over the course of Twin Peaksâ€™ original series run made for an ambitious and personal story. In the 1990s, TV viewers werenâ€™t used to long-arc serial dramas where the protagonist changed rapidly and irrevocably, the way protagonists are expected to in todayâ€™s stories. But while Twin Peaksâ€™ arc was compelling to many of the fans who stuck with it, it was wearying and demoralizing as well. The ratings trended steadily and sharply downward, peaking at milestones â€” the second season premiere, the reveal of who killed Laura Palmer â€” but still plummeting from the early days. The ratings drop was a form of feedback from a viewership who, like Cooper, werenâ€™t confident and eager anymore. They began rejecting the show as it rejected its early tone, and its early promise. As Twin Peaks developed, it became clear that it was about the maturing of a hero, but it was also about how the vast and incomprehensible aspects of his world claimed, consumed, and broke him. Viewers couldnâ€™t be blamed for pulling away from that story.And as Lynch withdrew from the show, it became narratively muddled, inconsistent, and sometimes downright silly. Cooperâ€™s story remains one relatively consistent throughline, but itâ€™s a tragic one, in which a fan-favorite character, the voice and point of view of the series, loses his joy, his freedom, and his capacity to control his own life. And it became the story of an audience that flocked to the show for lively, quirky surprises, and wound up splintered, divided, and uncertain.                Image: Showtime  Showtimeâ€™s series launches with Agent Cooper as thoroughly broken as heâ€™s ever been. The first two episodes find him still trapped in the Lodge, facing the shrieking spirit of Laura Palmer and an angry human-sized nervous system topped by a pulsing, talking brain. Heâ€™s ejected into space, threatened by an unseen force, and rescued by a blinded woman with unclear motives who helps him in unclear ways. Finally, heâ€™s fed through an electrical socket into what seems to be a decoy body, living its own life until he takes it over. By episode 4 of the series, heâ€™s stumbling around in a lobotomized daze, repeating whatever people say to him, bellowing â€œHelpâ€� at random strangers and â€œHelloooooo!â€� at slot machines. Heâ€™s confused, helpless, and only slowly regaining the tools he needs to function in this world.And so are we. The knowledge that Lynch has been given creative control of the show is a form of reassurance, a promise that even if the new Peaks narrative is baffling and bizarre, itâ€™s at least intended. Itâ€™s not the work of slot-fillers trying to pad out an infinitely ongoing program itâ€™s a creative mastermind trying to tell a specific story. But that story is once again leaving viewers at sea, trying to pick apart Lynchâ€™s work for tiny clues about what theyâ€™re watching. Weâ€™re back in Dale Cooperâ€™s position, wandering through a freshly revived world, and trying to catch up with the ways itâ€™s moved on in his absence.                Image: Showtime  The problem with the new Peaks as of episode 4, though, is that we have so little basis for understanding who our audience avatar is right now. Is Cooper mentally impaired because heâ€™s spent 25 years outside of time and space? Because heâ€™s stuck in a false, constructed body? Because Bob claimed some part of him while stealing his identity? Or just because Lynch thinks itâ€™s funny to have Kyle MacLachlan staggering around blank-faced, with a tie on his head and a dozen-word vocabulary? What are the stakes of the story at this point? What is the audience to make of a narrative shaped by a character who isnâ€™t capable of anything but following orders, following glowing magical sigils, and repeating whatever he hears? Like us, Cooper seems to have virtually no way of interpreting what heâ€™s seeing. For now, heâ€™s just along for the ride.we have so little basis for understanding our audience avatarThereâ€™s no reason to believe that old Agent Cooper will ever return to Twin Peaks. The brash, confident, charmingly oddball young man he was in 1990 is long gone, and with good reason, given what heâ€™s been through. In the same sort of way, no revival could ever recapture what Twin Peaks meant to audiences in 1990, when it was all so new and fresh and strange, so unlike anything that had ever appeared on network television.But heâ€™s still around in some form, still bouncing through the trials of a Lynchian world. Whatâ€™s missing now is any sense that he can help us understand what those trials mean. 1990s Cooper was an active force in his own story. He helped us navigate his surroundings, and see them with humor and wonder. He claimed, perhaps wrongly, but still convincingly, that there was order somewhere in the chaos. Itâ€™s natural for us to want to return to a mode where he can actively participate in his own story, where heâ€™s helping solve its mysteries, instead of acting as its biggest conundrum. But even with his humanity lost and his agency gone, he still represents us onscreen. Even when heâ€™s free-floating through a haze of glass boxes and stop-motion nightmares, weâ€™re still with him. Weâ€™re still all Agent Cooper, navigating the mystery, and waiting to see where this is all going.",2017.0,5.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,
2,"AI, the humanity!","
Sam Byford
",2017-05-30,"      AlphaGoâ€™s victory isnâ€™t a defeat for humans â€” itâ€™s an opportunity A loss for humanity! Man succumbs to machine! If you heard about AlphaGoâ€™s latest exploits last week â€” crushing the worldâ€™s best Go player and confirming that artificial intelligence had mastered the ancient Chinese board game â€” you may have heard the news delivered in doomsday terms.There was a certain melancholy to Ke Jieâ€™s capitulation, to be sure. The 19-year-old Chinese prodigy declared he would never lose to an AI following AlphaGoâ€™s earthshaking victory over Lee Se-dol last year. To see him onstage last week, nearly bent double over the Go board and fidgeting with his hair, was to see a man comprehensively put in his place.But focusing on that would miss the point. DeepMind, the Google-owned company that developed AlphaGo, isnâ€™t attempting to crush humanity â€” after all, the company is made up of humans itself. AlphaGo represents a major human achievement and the takeaway shouldnâ€™t be that AI is surpassing our abilities, but instead that AI will enhance our abilities.                Demis Hassabis, DeepMind co-founder and CEO.  When speaking to DeepMind and Google developers at the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, China last week, I didnâ€™t hear much about the four games AlphaGo won over Lee Se-dol last year. Instead, I heard a lot about the one that it lost.â€œWe were interested to see if we could fix the problems, the knowledge gaps as we call them, that Lee Se-dol brilliantly exposed in game four with his incredible win, showing that there was a weakness in AlphaGoâ€™s knowledge,â€� DeepMind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis said on the first day of the event. â€œWe worked hard to see if we could fix that knowledge gap and actually teach, or have AlphaGo learn itself, how to deal with those kinds of positions. Weâ€™re confident now that AlphaGo is better in those situations, but again we donâ€™t know for sure until we play against an amazing master like Ke Jie.â€�â€œAlphaGo Master has become its own teacher.â€�As it happened, AlphaGo steamrolled Ke into a 3-0 defeat, suggesting that those knowledge gaps have been closed. Itâ€™s worth noting, however, that DeepMind had to learn from AlphaGoâ€™s past mistakes to reach this level. If the AI had stood still for the past year, itâ€™s entirely possible that Ke would have won heâ€™s a far stronger player than Lee. But AlphaGo did not stand still.The version of AlphaGo that played Ke has been completely rearchitected â€” DeepMind calls it AlphaGo Master. â€œThe main innovation in AlphaGo Master is that itâ€™s become its own teacher,â€� says Dave Silver, DeepMindâ€™s lead researcher on AlphaGo. â€œSo [now] AlphaGo actually learns from its own searches to improve its neural networks, both the policy network and the value network, and this makes it learn in a much more general way. One of the things weâ€™re most excited about is not just that it can play Go better but we hope that thisâ€™ll actually lead to technologies that are more generally applicable to other challenging domains.â€�AlphaGo is comprised of two networks: a policy network that selects the next move to play, and a value network that analyzes the probability of winning. The policy network was initially based on millions of historical moves from actual games played by Go professionals. But AlphaGo Master goes much further by searching through the possible moves that could occur if a particular move is played, increasing its understanding of the potential fallout.â€œThe original system played against itself millions of times, but it didnâ€™t have this component of using the search,â€� Hassabis tells The Verge. â€œ[AlphaGo Master is] using its own strength to improve its own predictions. So whereas in the previous version it was mostly about generating data, in this version itâ€™s actually using the power of its own search function and its own abilities to improve one part of itself, the policy net.â€� Essentially, AlphaGo is now better at assessing why a particular move would be the strongest possible option.â€œThe whole idea is to reduce your reliance on that human bootstrapping step.â€�I asked Hassabis whether he thought this system could work without the initial dataset taken from historical games of Go. â€œWeâ€™re running those tests at the moment and weâ€™re pretty confident, actually,â€� he said. â€œThe initial results have been that itâ€™s looking pretty good. Thatâ€™ll be part of this future paper that weâ€™re going to publish, so weâ€™re not talking about that at the moment, but itâ€™s looking promising. The whole idea is to reduce your reliance on that human bootstrapping step.â€�But in order to defeat Ke, DeepMind needed to fix the weaknesses in the original AlphaGo that Lee exposed. Although the AI gets ever stronger by playing against itself, DeepMind couldnâ€™t rely on that baseline training to cover the knowledge gaps â€” nor could it hand-code a solution. â€œItâ€™s not like a traditional program where you just fix a bug,â€� says Hassabis, who believes that similar knowledge gaps are likely to be a problem faced by all kinds of learning systems in the future. â€œYou have to kind of coax it to learn new knowledge or explore that new area of the domain, and there are various strategies to do that. You can use adversarial opponents that push you into exploring those spaces, and you can keep different varieties of the AlphaGo versions to play each other so thereâ€™s more variety in the player pool.â€� â€œAnother thing we did is when we assessed what kinds of positions we thought AlphaGo had a problem with, we looked at the self-play games and we identified games algorithmically â€” we wrote another algorithm to look at all those games and identify places where AlphaGo seemed to have this kind of problem. So we have a library of those sorts of positions, and we can test our new systems not only against each other in the self-play but against this database of known problematic positions, so then we could quantify the improvement against that.â€�                Dave Silver, DeepMindâ€™s lead researcher on AlphaGo.  None of this increase in performance has required an increase in power. In fact, AlphaGo Master uses much less power than the version of AlphaGo that beat Lee Se-dol it runs on a single second-gen Tensor Processing Unit machine in the Google Cloud, whereas the previous version used 50 TPUs at once. â€œYou shouldnâ€™t think of this as running on compute power thatâ€™s beyond the access of normal people,â€� says Silver. â€œThe special thing about it is the algorithm thatâ€™s being used as opposed to the amount of compute.â€�AlphaGo learned from humans, and humans are learning from AlphaGoAlphaGo is learning from humans, then, even if it may not need to in the future. And in turn, humans have learned from AlphaGo. The simplest demonstration of this came in Ke Jieâ€™s first match against the AI, where he used a 3-3 point as part of his opening strategy. Thatâ€™s a move that fell out of favor over the past several decades, but itâ€™s seen a resurgence in popularity after AlphaGo employed it to some success. And Ke pushed AlphaGo to its limits in the second game the AI determined that his first 50 moves were â€œperfect,â€� and his first 100 were better than anyone had ever played against the Master version.Although the Go community might not necessarily understand why a given AlphaGo move works in the moment, the AI provides a whole new way to approach the game. Go has been around for thousands of years, and AlphaGo has sparked one of the most profound shifts yet in how the game is played and studied. But if youâ€™re reading this in the West, you probably donâ€™t play Go. What can AlphaGo do for you?                Andrew Jackson and Lee Ha-jin discuss AlphaGo's first game against Ke Jie.  Say youâ€™re a data center architect working at Google. Itâ€™s your job to make sure everything runs efficiently and coolly. To date, youâ€™ve achieved that by designing the system so that youâ€™re running as few pieces of cooling equipment at once as possible â€” you turn on the second piece only after the first is maxed out, and so on. This makes sense, right? Well, a variant of AlphaGo named Dr. Data disagreed. â€œWhat Dr. Data decided to do was actually turn on as many units as possible and run them at a very low level,â€� Hassabis says. â€œBecause of the switching and the pumps and the other things, that turned out to be better â€” and I think theyâ€™re now taking that into new data center designs, potentially. Theyâ€™re taking some of those ideas and reincorporating them into the new designs, which obviously the AI system canâ€™t do. So the human designers are looking at what the AlphaGo variant was doing, and then thatâ€™s informing their next decisions.â€� Dr. Data is at work right now in Googleâ€™s data centers, saving the company 40 percent in electricity required for cooling and resulting in 15 percent overall less energy usage. DeepMind believes that the same principle will apply to science and health care, with deep-learning techniques helping to improve the accuracy and efficiency of everything from protein-folding to radiography. Perhaps less ambitiously but no less importantly, it may also lead to more sensible workflows. â€œYou can imagine across a hospital or many hospitals you might be able to figure out that thereâ€™s this process one hospitalâ€™s using, or one nurse is using, thatâ€™s super effective over time,â€� says Hassabis. â€œMaybe theyâ€™re doing something slightly different to this other hospital, and perhaps the other hospital can learn from that. I think at the moment youâ€™d never know that was happening, but you can imagine that an AI system might be able to pick up on that and share that knowledge effectively between different doctors and hospitals so they all end up with the best practice.â€�            These are areas particularly fraught with roadblocks and worries for many, of course. And itâ€™s natural for people to be suspicious of AI â€” I experienced it myself somewhat last week. My hotel was part of the same compound as the Future of Go Summit, and access to certain areas was gated by Baiduâ€™s machine learning-powered facial recognition tech. It worked instantly, every time, often without me even knowing where the camera was Iâ€™d just go through the gate and see my Verge profile photo flash up on a screen. I never saw it fail for the thousands of other people at the event, either. And all of this worked based on nothing more than a picture of me taken on an iPad at check-in. I know that Facebook and Google and probably tons of other companies also know what I look like. But the weird feeling I got from seeing my face flawlessly recognized multiple times a day for a week shows that companies ought to be sensitive about the way they roll out AI technologies. It also, to some extent, probably explains why so many people seem unsettled by AlphaGoâ€™s success.But again, that success is a success built by humans. AlphaGo is already demonstrating the power of what can happen not only when AI learns from us, but when we learn from AI. At this stage, itâ€™s technology worth being optimistic about.Photography by Sam Byford / The Verge",2017.0,5.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

",2017-05-25,"      Super Deluxe built a weird internet empire. Can it succeed on TV? When Wolfgang Hammer talks about the future of entertainment, people listen. Hammer is the mastermind behind the American reboot of House of Cards, the guy with the unlikely idea of bringing together David Fincher and a forgotten BBC series. He oversaw two of CBS Filmsâ€™ first prestige movies: the Coen brothersâ€™ Inside Llewyn Davis and Martin McDonaghâ€™s Seven Psychopaths. Heâ€™s had a charmed career: leap-frogging from a masterâ€™s degree at Stanford to an entry-level job at Media Rights Capital to eventually becoming the president of CBSâ€™s fledgling films division. So when Hammer came to Turner with an ambitious concept, the cable giant was willing to entertain it. Turner owns TBS, TNT, CNN, and Cartoon Network, but what Hammer was proposing was something altogether different: an all-in-one production company that would thrive online and pretty much do whatever it wanted. Now 18 months old, Super Deluxe is being nurtured with a reliable budget and total creative freedom, and itâ€™s given Hammer the opportunity to play fairy godmother, granting wishes for creators who want to make interesting, innovative art. Super Deluxe isnâ€™t a traditional production company, media company, or art house, but it is a go-between for young talent who have struggled to break the bubble around the Hollywood institutions that can launch stars. Over a series of phone interviews, Hammer declined to divulge how much money Super Deluxe gets from Turner. Hammer says they donâ€™t have an annual budget from Turner â€” just a â€œpot of moneyâ€� that gets replenished if they do well.And if they donâ€™t? â€œWell, then weâ€™re out of luck, and thereâ€™s no more Super Deluxe.â€� In the meantime, Hammerâ€™s ambitions are grand â€” and he wields the power and jargon to match. He brushes off an employeeâ€™s comparison to Walt Disney, but says, â€œIf you want to say that we aspire to be vertically integrated like the largest entertainment company the world has ever seenâ€¦ thatâ€™s probably true.â€� He wants to make apps, games, merch, documentaries, viral videos, Instagram stars, his own technology for Facebook Live, and, most importantly, as many of the 50 original TV shows his team has been developing as possible. The looming question now is whether Hammer can bring all these pieces together into a package that appeals to a large audience. With the recent sale of Super Deluxeâ€™s first big television show The Chances, itâ€™s almost time to find out.You may not have heard of Super Deluxe, but if youâ€™re part of the demographic that spends its days online, youâ€™ve likely seen its work. Super Deluxe is the force behind some of last yearâ€™s greatest internet hoaxes and the weirdest diced-up video edits of the dystopian circus that was the 2016 election. In the last 18 months, the studio produced dozens of scripts for TV comedies, 8-bit video games based on memes, and a Facebook Live video that got pulled for nudity. Theyâ€™re the specter behind the web magazine Extremely Good Shit and the multi-platform juggernaut Joanne the Scammer. Most recently, theyâ€™ve worked with YouTube and Instagram stars like Poppy, Bread Face, and @ScorpionDagger. Their creative director, former Vice editor-in-chief Jesse Pearson, is big on DIY videos â€” teaching valuable skills like how to give yourself a stick-and-poke tattoo or build your own gravity bong.Hammer says Super Deluxe is averse to â€œnoise,â€� but their content belies that assertion, both figuratively and literally: they made the easy Oscars Best Picture fuck-up remix just like everyone else their go-to sound effects are literally air horns and screams. A lot of the political humor that doesnâ€™t come from fan-fave contributor Vic Berger is gallows-y in a way that can feel cheap, even market-tested, leaning hard on the internetâ€™s favorite mode of speaking â€” existential dread and off-hand quips about doomsday. Sometimes Super Deluxe can feel like a play for counterculture street cred at a time when the counterculture isnâ€™t that fringe.                 Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge      Wolfgang Hammer.                  Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge      Winnie Kemp.  You almost certainly havenâ€™t seen the other half of the company. At Sundance in January, it debuted a documentary about Martin Luther King Jr. speechwriter Bayard Rustin, alongside a four-minute viral video about a teenâ€™s friendship with a wild deer. Super Deluxe also premiered The Chances, a concept that the companyâ€™s VP of original programming, Winnie Kemp, stumbled across on Kickstarter itâ€™s now in production as a half-hour TV show. The Chances is the first show to star deaf characters written by deaf writers and played by deaf actors. Its creators, Shoshannah Stern and Josh Feldman, are completely unknown. Super Deluxe is everywhere and nowhere, taking credit for things when they feel like it, eschewing it if it seems like itâ€™ll be more fun that way. Sometimes Super Deluxe even goes out of its way to obfuscate its involvement, like it did when its tech team spurred the short-lived rumor that Drake and Rihanna were about to drop a collaborative album by launching drakeandrihanna.com. According to Hammer, thereâ€™s no reason all these seemingly unrelated projects shouldnâ€™t exist side by side â€” thereâ€™s no brand identity more compelling than â€œcomplete creative freedom.â€�  To build that brand, Hammer borrowed a little bit of something old. The original incarnation of Super Deluxe, born in 2007 and scrapped in 2008, was a slightly edgier and way less popular Funny or Die, with comedy talent borrowed from Turnerâ€™s Adult Swim. When Hammer presented his untitled business plan, he asked if he could revive the name, knowing that most of the audience he planned to court would likely never have heard of the original: â€œWe thought the name was timeless and if we did our jobs right, would eventually become an adjective.â€� Super Deluxe now has a staff of 120 full-time employees, tasked with turning a number of well-intentioned oddball web experiments into a financially viable commodity. The studio is leveling up: it recently added former Vice sales executive Thomas Nolan to lead an ad sales team, and itâ€™s planning on taking more shows to market throughout the year. This fall, Super Deluxe will be taking over a 90-minute late-night programming block on TBS. In the old model of self-made online success, the only way to make money was to make a lot of free content for indifferent platforms like YouTube and Twitter, accrue followers, then hope and pray that someone would grant you a book deal or a part in a commercial. You could have millions of fans and still subsist on Top Ramen. That model treats raw talent like fuel, and inevitably, fuels get burned. Across the board, YouTube personalities disappear far more often than they transition into stable stardom. Super Deluxe isnâ€™t the first to consider paying young people to do the stuff theyâ€™re already doing for free. Plenty of others have tried to do the same, operating under the assumption that throwing money at a rising internet star is enough to jumpstart success and mass appeal. But a big budget doesnâ€™t erase skeletons from the closet, nor can it structure a series-length story around a character that shines in five-minute YouTube videos. PewDiePieâ€™s Disney deal imploded in February, partly the result of his flippant, detached attitude toward the Holocaust, while YouTube star Miranda Singsâ€™ disappointing Netflix show last year was bloated and clearly lacked a savvy editor in the writersâ€™ room.            Companies built specifically to exploit internet talent havenâ€™t fared much better â€” experiments like DreamWorksâ€™ AwesomenessTV, Verizonâ€™s Go90, and even YouTubeâ€™s own premium service have fallen short of expectations for one reason or another. Other, more successful, networks of YouTube creators have been gobbled up by corporations: Warner Bros. acquired Machinimaâ€™s loose network of gaming vloggers last year, folding all of its content into AT&ampampTâ€™s purview and angling for better promo for its DC Comics properties. Disney acquired Maker, along with most of its management, in 2014. A year later, power struggles between the YouTube network and Disneyâ€™s corporate megastructure was already leading to layoffs and deflated expectations. Only a few â€œcreatorsâ€� have managed to truly break through, unaltered â€” the remarkably driven Hannah Hart, the creator of â€œMy Drunk Kitchenâ€� or the Fine Brothers, who maintain a YouTube channel with 15 million subscribers and managed to launch their own production company. Super Deluxe has a new approach, one it thinks supports creatives and simultaneously holds corporate influence at armâ€™s length.Kemp explains Super Deluxeâ€™s role in the entertainment industry in buzzy startup terms: â€œWeâ€™re almost like an incubator. Weâ€™re able to help [young creators] preserve what they want to make and present it in a way that makes bigger companies feel confident that the execution and the creative is all going to be there when we make it.â€� Translated: Super Deluxe gives these creators experienced production teams, the resource of their enormous industry network, notes on their drafts, and yeah, space and time and money. Their crown jewel is Branden Millerâ€™s Joanne the Scammer, a self-described â€œmessy bitch who lives for dramaâ€� who was discovered, of all places, on Instagram by the companyâ€™s then-social media manager Jason Richards. Miller says when he and Wolfgang Hammer met for the first time, Hammer told him, alternately, â€œYouâ€™re going to be a starâ€� and â€œYouâ€™re already a star.â€� Miller signed on for three videos as Joanne less than a year later, he landed a cover story in The Fader. Now heâ€™s working with Super Deluxe to put together a half-hour comedy series to pitch for TV and churning out increasingly elaborate short films. He has an app and merch â€” heâ€™s one of the most diversely monetized internet creators currently working. But in his Fader story he was careful to point out how fragile that is: â€œ[People] know my past and they donâ€™t feel that Iâ€™m worthy of being verified or talking to celebrities. I have to be funny at all times. If I say something not funny, the one thing â€” they donâ€™t give me a second chance. Iâ€™m cancelled.â€� Before The Chances, Super Deluxe had only sold one show in development â€” Magic Funhouse, a raunchy half-hour comedy about a drug-addled kidsâ€™ TV show host that scored two seasons with the AT&ampampT-owned YouTube network and digital content distributor Fullscreen. Thatâ€™s a sale Kemp and Hammer are proud of. But Sundance Now is a whole other ballgame, a full-blown TV service you can subscribe to through Amazon. The Chances will be that serviceâ€™s first original scripted series. When Kemp first met with Stern and Feldman, she and her team were so impressed by their ideas and commitment that they offered to fund the web series on the spot. Once signed, Kemp surrounded the creators with a production team, a director from the Deaf West theater company, and her teamâ€™s help selling the series for television.Watching the seriesâ€™s shorts, itâ€™s easy to see why Kemp found The Chances so exciting, as well as how much work there still is to do. Stern and Feldman play best friends navigating bizarre, incredibly specific situations, from a UTI that causes Sternâ€™s character to pee at the table at her anniversary dinner, to an episode about clunky movie theater closed captioning devices, to a tender take on the â€œsomeone accidentally got super highâ€� comedy trope. Thereâ€™s not much there in the way of an overarching story, but the ease between the two leads, and the confidence of the writing, is obvious. Itâ€™s reminiscent of the early YouTube shorts that eventually became Broad City â€” little in the way of plot, but the characters are golden, and obviously belong together.                The Chances.  To rebuild the show as a half-hour drama, Stern and Feldman started from scratch, sending episode drafts to Kemp for notes before polishing them up and submitting them to the Sundance team. Super Deluxe will hire producers and a director, but Feldman and Stern will still write every episode themselves â€” just like they would have done if Super Deluxe had never come along. When it comes to the script, the company plays support. Kemp recognizes that Super Deluxeâ€™s primary role in the next few months will be in maturing Stern and Feldman as writers: guiding them through the process of constructing a TV show with several storylines, developing more interesting side characters, and spinning up satisfying narrative arcs. The Chances is an opportunity for Super Deluxe to prove that its soul is really where Hammer and Kemp and Pearson insist it is. â€œWeâ€™re always looking for fresh and unique perspectives, from Vic Berger to Joanne,â€� says Kemp. â€œWe always bring it back to â€˜What does this particular creator have to say? How is it going to ripple through the society at large, and hopefully make some kind of impact or be a point of conversation?â€™ I just feel like thatâ€™s the spirit of everything that the company is making, at its core.â€� Pearson echoes her, saying, â€œItâ€™s kind of finding the right voices and tone and then letting them do what they do rather than mediating or editorializing too much on what they doâ€¦ Iâ€™ve always leaned toward the voice that speaks in the margins, because I believe thatâ€™s where the future is made.â€� Hammer takes it even further: â€œThis idea that you have pieces like [The Chances] living next to some of the pieces we make for Live or Snapchat or YouTube â€” that breadth is unparalleled. It doesnâ€™t exist. You canâ€™t point to a company in the entertainment space that does that. And thatâ€™s whatâ€™s exciting about Super Deluxe.â€� When The Chances premieres next year, Stern and Feldman have a pretty good idea of who will watch it: â€œWhat will make our show so relatable is that everyone can understand how it feels to be on the outside looking in, wanting to be a part of something.â€�But The Chances wonâ€™t premiere until early next year, and in the meantime Super Deluxe has to shop its other shows around and hedge its bets. Theyâ€™re doing that with an ever-widening roster of YouTube videos, Facebook Live interactive stunts, apps, mobile games, an aggressively irreverent social media presence, and, of course, a go at an Adult Swim-esque TBS late-night block. Facebook Live is a venue where Super Deluxe excels. The tech team, led by CTO Shahruz Shaukat, has built its own box of tools that supplement what Facebook provides, allowing them to make their shows far more interactive than videos made by most other brands. Viewers can collaboratively punch a Nazi, assemble a taco, or decide which celebrities will get a visit from a stop-motion Grim Reaper in 2017. Pearson says Facebook Liveâ€™s â€œpunk rockâ€� energy appeals to him â€” â€œItâ€™s chaotic, itâ€™s spontaneous, itâ€™s like walking a tightwire. It ties back to the early days of television in some ways.â€� Itâ€™s also an opportunity: a product owned and supported by what is inarguably the most powerful content distributor in history, and one that not many people know what to do with it yet. They recently put together a Choose Your Own Adventure telenovela purely dictated by audience input on Live, a concept novel enough to get picked up by dozens of internet culture blogs. These videos rack up hundreds of thousands or sometimes millions of views, which makes Super Deluxe the platformâ€™s biggest star. Kevin Reilly, the chief creative officer of Turner Entertainment says heâ€™s proud of the work Super Deluxe has done so far, explaining, â€œWe started Super Deluxe to create unique experiences for a discerning consumer of video on social.â€� It has obviously done that. On the other hand, Richard Greenfield, a media and tech analyst at the investment firm BTIG, told me he was impressed by what Super Deluxe is attempting. But, bottom line: â€œThereâ€™s no clear path to Super Deluxe making billions of dollars. Most of the traditional media companies make tens of billions of dollars.â€�Thatâ€™s not to say Super Deluxe canâ€™t be successful. Their advertising business is just getting off the ground, and theyâ€™ve got the audience everyone wants. Though it might seem risky building infrastructure around untested talent, the process is ultimately pretty lean. And having total editorial independence from their principal benefactor gives Super Deluxe the freedom to avoid the standard pitfalls of entertainment production â€” costly rewrites, staffing change-ups, projects killed on the vine, ideas that get bloated and rendered amorphous by a cacophony of contributing voices. Everyone who works there prides themselves on speed, and saving young talent from development hell. If Super Deluxe is the future of entertainment, itâ€™s because it isnâ€™t much like a TV channel or a media company. Itâ€™s more like a tool for supporting inexperienced talent in a entertainment world thatâ€™s been stuck in its ways. Being on every single platform at once makes Super Deluxe as multi-functional as a Swiss army knife. It can serve as a translator between two parties â€” the amateurs of the internet and the stubborn pros of Hollywood â€” who are constantly dancing around each other. That idea courses through every single thing Super Deluxe produces. The studio will bring Joanne the Scammer, an Instagram star, to TV. It took a viral homemade documentary to Sundance. It intends to monetize Facebook Live by throwing together young talent and unique tech on a rickety, bare-bones platform. Super Deluxeâ€™s hustle mimics that of the stars it hopes to create â€” success could be anywhere, so you might as well try everything.

4,How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game,"
Nick Statt
",2017-05-22,"      Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories â€” batteries, cables, chargers â€” would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. There were just a few problems: Yang knew nothing about starting a company, building consumer electronics, or selling products. â€œI was a software engineer all my life at Google. I didnâ€™t know anyone in the electronics manufacturing world,â€� Yang tells me over Skype from his office in Shenzhen, China. But he started the company regardless, thanks in no small part to his previous experience with Amazonâ€™s sellers marketplace, a platform for third-party companies and tiny one- or two-person teams interested in selling directly to consumers. He named the company Anker, after the German word for ship anchor.The steady rise of the companyâ€™s profile is proof that itâ€™s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that waveAnker has since become the most popular brand of portable battery packs on Amazon. Portable chargers had a bit of a standout moment last summer, when players of the wildly popular and battery-hogging PokÃ©mon Go could be seen roaming the streets, their phones constantly plugged in. But these accessories have existed for years as a remedy for our battery woes since the standard smartphone tends to last no more than a day on a single charge. So in airports, the back of cabs, and on city streets weâ€™re plugging into lithium-ion slabs in our pockets and bags to stay connected. The market for portable battery packs generated $360 million in the 12 months ending in March 2017 in the US alone. The brands behind these packs are largely anonymous â€” Kmashi, Jackery, and iMuto â€” and they often stay that way. Except Anker. The steady rise of the companyâ€™s profile is proof that itâ€™s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave as it continues to ripple out to other markets. A majority of Ankerâ€™s sales come from cables and wall chargers, and itâ€™s now moving into the smart home and auto market â€” anywhere a plug and a cable can solve a problem. Yang and his team started a company with the sole purpose of selling a better third-party accessory. But they stumbled onto a more lucrative reality: mobile phones, once niche luxury items, are now ubiquitous centerpieces of our digital lives. Each of these phones, and all the products that connect to them, need their own cable and plug. And each and every day these devices die before we want them to.                 PowerCore 10000.  If thereâ€™s anything you should know about smartphone development over the last 10 years, itâ€™s this: batteries are not lasting longer. Phones may be thinner and faster, with larger screens and better cameras, but they donâ€™t stay powered for longer than a day, perhaps 36 hours at best. The culprit is the fundamental science of lithium-ion batteries, which are tremendous at storing energy but only within limited size and capacity constraints.The lithium-ion batteries we have today operate at about a fifth of their potential storage capacity, says Lynden Archer, a professor of chemical engineering at Cornell University. And yet thatâ€™s still at about 90 percent of the maximum potential todayâ€™s battery science allows. â€œA breakthrough would require a new paradigm,â€� he says. â€œA huge part of Ankerâ€™s success is the fact that our batteries donâ€™t last long enough.â€�That stagnation has allowed Anker to flourish. â€œA huge part of Ankerâ€™s success is the fact that our batteries donâ€™t last long enough,â€� says Joanna Stern, a technology columnist and gadget reviewer for The Wall Street Journal. â€œThey saw that accessories needed to be made to address customersâ€™ pain points. Theyâ€™re making the chargers, the cases, the cords â€” and theyâ€™re making it for affordable prices so you can have one of these in every place you are.â€�Mobile battery packs werenâ€™t the companyâ€™s initial goal. In the late 2000s, Yang identified a consumer need not being met: well-built, reliable laptop battery replacements. â€œYou have a Dell or HP laptop â€” letâ€™s assume you got it in 2009 â€” and in 2011 the battery is dying and you want to get a new one,â€� he says. Back then you had two choices: buy directly from Dell or HP, with a high price tag, or buy a white-label battery thatâ€™s cheap but poorly made. â€œWhich one do I want to buy?â€� asks Yang. â€œThe answer is neither of them.â€�Yang saw a desire for a better type of accessory â€” one that wouldnâ€™t cost as much as a replacement straight from the original manufacturer, but that would be of a high enough quality to earn consumersâ€™ trust. Before he could sell that product, he needed to figure out how to make it. It was a long and painful process. After he quit his job at Google in July 2011, Anker took 12 months just to prototype its first laptop battery. That was even after Yang and the core team moved to Shenzhen to find reliable manufacturing partners. â€œI knew that if I stayed in California and had people FedEx me prototypes in a week, it was just not going to work,â€� he says. Many hardware companies, especially crowdfunded ones in the US, learn that lesson the hard way, missing deadlines and hitting snags that lead to months-long delays. A solid supply chain is so crucial to a hardware companyâ€™s survival that thereâ€™s an entire consulting industry around helping startups find suppliers and set expectations. Critical to avoiding these pitfalls was Dongpong Zhao, Googleâ€™s then-head of sales in China. Zhao joined Anker in early 2012, and helped Yang build out the companyâ€™s supply chain. Anker was made up of around ten people at the time. â€œThink of it as a small family business instead of like an actual company,â€� Yang says. The company tirelessly built out a supply chain in its first year and began testing its first products â€” the laptop chargers and batteries it would begin selling direct to consumers on Amazon. â€œWe were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity. That got us quite the reputation.â€�From there, Anker ventured into smartphone batteries with a replacement unit for the HTC Sensation. â€œWe were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity,â€� Yang says. â€œThat got us quite the reputation.â€� Early on, Anker developed close relationships with suppliers in Asia, including Panasonic and anode supplier BTR, to help test and quickly develop new batteries. Yang says he and Ankerâ€™s small team â€œdefinitely saw the explosion of smart devicesâ€� as its biggest and most obvious opportunity, and Anker started aggressively expanding into portable battery packs, wall chargers, and cables. By the end of 2012, after shifting more resources toward portable chargers, Yang says Anker went from selling 100 to 1,000 products per day. â€œThe challenge wasnâ€™t selling products,â€� Yang says. â€œIt was making products and making sure they were high-quality as well. Thatâ€™s why we spent a majority of our effort on R&ampampD and product development.â€� The company does a majority of its sales directly to consumers over Amazon Marketplace, where a combination of strong reviews, low prices, and prominent placement in search rankings can turn a single product into a lucrative line. For the accessories market, which tends to piggyback off trends in mainstream consumer electronics, a true breakthrough is rare. But Anker found one in charging, based on the realization that while batteries may not be improving, charging time certainly was. According a study conducted last year by PhoneArena, it took more than two hours on average to charge a device to 100 percent in 2013. Today, it can be done in almost half the time. So Anker set out to make the fastest chargers available.            Take the PowerPort 5, a matte black rectangle no larger than a deck of playing cards, with five USB ports. When it was first introduced in 2015, it was the only accessory on the market capable of charging five devices simultaneously at optimal speed. Or the companyâ€™s standard PowerCore portable charger, roughly the size of a credit card and just under one inch thick â€” a white block encasing 10,000mAh of lithium-ion battery cells. It has four pinholes that light up in LED blue when you press an elliptical button on the top to check its remaining charge. It can refill a depleted iPhone 7 in just over 60 minutes nearly four times over before it needs to be recharged.  Most Anker charging products have one signature: the PowerIQ logo. Launched in 2013, the companyâ€™s proprietary charging standard is now present on nearly all of its batteries and wall plugs. The technology, carried by a small chip inside each charger, identifies whatever device is being plugged in, be it an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, or an iPad Pro 9.7-inch, in order to detect and deliver the maximum current the product allows. Anker says the technology can shave hours off the amount of time it takes to reach a full charge. A next-generation version of the chip, a sequel to PowerIQ, is slated to start shipping in new Anker charging products later this year, allowing for smaller and lighter accessories.            On top of its productsâ€™ technical advantages, Anker banks on looks to make its chargers stand out. Brand manager Elisa Lu says every deviceâ€™s packaging is carefully thought out from the moment customers receive the product, to when they open it and use it. Devices come in a white-and-light-blue box with the name Anker printed in all caps across the front. Inside is a meticulously packaged arrangement of lightweight cardboard. Anker products carry that new gadget smell â€” a blend of peculiar odors from the evaporation of chemical compounds in the plastics and the epoxy coatings of the device. Beside its red cables, which Anker offers in both standard and braided nylon versions, and a single one-off red battery pack, the company sells products in only two color options: black and white. All this has a strategic business purpose. â€œWhen our consumers receive our products, we want to make sure they know they are getting it from a reliable and trustworthy company,â€� Lu says. Brand trust is a pivotal consideration when purchasing what may seem like random electronics off Amazon. Inside the the box with Ankerâ€™s larger products, youâ€™ll also find a small square piece of paper with two questions: are you happy, or are you unhappy? If youâ€™re unhappy, a block of text instructs you to contact Anker customer support via phone, email, or on its website. If youâ€™re satisfied, it asks you to tell your friends or family. Better yet, leave an Amazon review.                PowerCore Slim 5000.  In many ways, Ankerâ€™s success is born from the failures of premier manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Where those companies introduce points of friction â€” like ever-thinner devices with short battery lives â€” Anker offers a remedy.â€œMy feeling is that Anker is a success because Apple offers such subpar and expensive accessories,â€� says Stern, whoâ€™s often recommended Anker products in her WSJ column. It may be surprising that Apple sat idly as the accessory market ballooned around it it took the company years to develop its own battery case for the iPhone to compete with Mophie. But Apple has always favored high margins on premium products, even the cables and earbuds it sells in the Apple Store. This has given ample room to companies like Anker, with the low overhead of an e-commerce business, to sell similar products of near-identical quality for $10 to $20 cheaper. And where Apple and others failed to develop products of their own like multi-port wall plugs and portable chargers, Anker saw the opportunity and capitalized on it. The company is quick to fill gaps created by smartphone manufacturers. When Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, for instance, Anker saw a giant opportunity to begin producing new dongles and other cable adapters to help consumers adjust.But mastering Amazon was the real key to securing Ankerâ€™s future. Search for a generic accessory like â€œcellphone wall chargerâ€� or â€œLightning cableâ€� and youâ€™ll find the Anker brand high up in the search resultsIf you head over to Amazon.com right now and peruse the retailerâ€™s most popular smartphone accessories and youâ€™ll find Anker products at the top. Search for a generic accessory like â€œcellphone wall chargerâ€� or â€œLightning cableâ€� and youâ€™ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results, typically with a 4.5 or 5-star rating. In fact, Anker products take up the first five slots on Amazonâ€™s list of best-selling portable batteries. And alongside the ratings, youâ€™ll find thousands of customer reviews â€” reviews that the company scans meticulously for ideas on how to improve their development process.Two years before he left Google, Yang became intimately familiar with Amazonâ€™s Marketplace when he built an automated system for a friend who was selling third-party products on Amazon as a side business. It essentially took care of aspects of the business like inventory, logistics and fulfillment, and sales tracking. â€œIt took me two months, evenings and weekends, to develop this system,â€� Yang explained in a video produced by Amazon last year to promote entrepreneurship on its platform. â€œWithin a month, she was fulfilling 300 orders a day.â€�Building this system gave Yang invaluable insight into how third-party selling on Amazon functioned. He discovered what worked and what didnâ€™t, and how entire brands could crop up overnight and fade into obscurity the next day. Anker thrived by borrowing infrastructure from Amazon and relying on engineering and support in China. â€œAmazon provides loads of services â€” financial services, fulfillment. It actually makes selling a low-barrier thing,â€� Yang says. Although the company attempted to handle its own fulfillment in its early days, it eventually discovered it could not compete with what Amazon offered. Now, about 95 percent of Ankerâ€™s products are listed as â€œFulfilled by Amazon.â€� You can build an online retail business off Amazon, but making sure your products get exposure is the hard part. â€œThe biggest challenge for Anker is not sales. Itâ€™s customer perception,â€� Yang says. â€œPeople think they need [Appleâ€™s] cube charger and stock cable.â€� Teaching people that there is a superior product out there, and then convincing them to keep buying, is Ankerâ€™s core challenge. â€œAmazon reviews were really enormously helpful,â€� Yang says. â€œThe Amazon reviews just come and come automatically.â€�                PowerLine+ USB-C to USB 3.0.  Silicon Valley is full of breathless mission statements designed to inspire and justify the power and influence of technology, like Appleâ€™s famous â€œthink differentâ€� slogan, and Googleâ€™s ominous and now defunct â€œdonâ€™t be evilâ€� mantra. Facebook, back in 2012, celebrated its billion-user milestone with an ad comparing the social network to chairs, bridges, and even nations. Anker has never aspired to such grand ambitions. â€œAt Anker, we can't exactly help you unwind,â€� the company admits on its Amazon sellers page. Instead, Anker takes a more straightforward approach by solving the inevitable problems technology creates. â€œSay goodbye to first-world tech woes like oppressive low batteries and limited ports,â€� the page says. â€œSay hello to an easier, smarter life.â€�Yang is trying to extend this simple philosophy to categories like headphones, speakers, phone cases, and now smart home appliances under a new brand called Eufy. Launched last September, Eufy is Ankerâ€™s avenue for selling things like Roomba clones, desk lamps, and bathroom scales. Expanding into more product categories is a logical evolution for Anker, but itâ€™s also a response to a looming existential threat: Yang says he foresees a future where portable chargers wonâ€™t be necessary due to advancements in both fast charging and wireless charging. â€œI think we all agree that the portable charger isnâ€™t forever,â€� Yang says. But consumers will always need wall plugs and cables, and Anker sees its goal now as keeping pace with changing standards, like the introduction of USB-C.                 PowerCore 5000.  In the meantime, Yang says itâ€™s diversifying with a future expansion into audio, smart home, and automotive product lines. Anker already produces Bluetooth headphones and speakers, but it has aspirations to compete with the likes of Harman Kardon and Bose. Key to the success of those products is moving to brick-and-mortar retailers. Terrence Wang, the companyâ€™s chief marketing officer hired from Procter &ampamp Gamble in 2015, says having a presence in Best Buy and Walmart, a process that began last year, is the next stage of Ankerâ€™s evolution. â€œExpanding from online to offline is critical actually,â€� Wang says. â€œWe are trying to get as many people to know that they have a simple, convenient, portable, fast solution rather than just have to bring their own charger wherever they go. Thatâ€™s the original brand vision.â€� The companyâ€™s focus on storefront retail is a response to a second very real threat â€” dependence on a direct-to-consumer, online-only model. The company has found it difficult these days to launch new products on Amazon. Older products have thousands of reviews, while newer ones need to earn placement in the search rankings and collect testimonials before more cautious buyers pull the trigger. â€œWeâ€™re seeing a bit of a dilemma on that one,â€� Yang says. â€œTo a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices.â€�The company is also struggling with its complex product line, with a dizzying number of choices that may alienate consumers who are looking for a simple choice. â€œWeâ€™re converging to this generation approach,â€� Yang says. â€œSo weâ€™ll try to release a generation of products every 18 to 24 months.â€� Choosing which products to promote at Best Buy, which to discontinue, and where to put resources for the future are all part of Ankerâ€™s growing pains.The companyâ€™s success hinges on convincing â€” or â€œeducatingâ€� â€” their consumers about the value of what theyâ€™re offering. Yang likes to tell a story about a moment he sees play out on repeat every single time heâ€™s at an airport, anywhere on the planet. He sees people, smartphones in hand, rushing from outlet to outlet, looking for space with â€œthe little Apple cube in their handsâ€� and running out of options. â€œTo a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices, in their mind,â€� he says. â€œI look at those people and I always want to go up to them and talk to them.â€�Instead, Yang and the Anker team started conducting an annual consumer survey. It has only one question: how often does your smartphone run out of battery? Once every day? Once a week? Once a month? Or perhaps never? â€œForty percent of people say their battery ran out at least once last week, another 40 percent say at least once last month,â€� Yang says. â€œAs long as these numbers donâ€™t go down, I think we have a lot of work to do.â€�",2017.0,5.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

6,Instant recall,"
Casey Newton
",2017-04-16,"      Facebook's Instant Articles promised to transform journalism â€” but now big publishers are fleeing Inside Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters, the arrival of Instant Articles in the spring of 2015 was presented as a cause for celebration. Talking with reporters, executives described the fast-loading, natively hosted articles as a promising new creative format. A suite of publishing tools incubated in Facebook's now-defunct newsreading app Paper would find their way to Instant Articles, executives said, evolving the news posts shared on Facebook into immersive multimedia experiences.For publishers â€” and journalism â€” the stakes were high. Readers who once regularly visited their desktop websites now got their news from Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and other apps outside of publishersâ€™ control. For many large publishers, survival would depend on whether they could build loyal audiences inside third-party mobile apps. Publishers were wary. Some feared Facebook would absorb so much content behind its walled garden that the web itself could be at risk. â€œPlatforms are eating our business, and weâ€™re letting it happen,â€� wrote Mat Yurow, then director of audience development at The New York Times. â€œDo you have any proof that publishers using another companyâ€™s proprietary platform have ever created a lasting and sustainable business?â€� asked John Battelle, a media industry veteran. (The answer appeared to be no.)â€œPlatforms are eating our business, and weâ€™re letting it happen.â€�There was optimism, too. Facebookâ€™s daily aggregation of eyeballs is the largest in human history, and publishers were eager for the chance to capture more of them. It seemed possible that a superior reading experience could benefit readers, publishers, and Facebook at the same time. â€œIn the long run,â€� wrote Will Oremus at Slate, some might find theyâ€™re better off outsourcing their distribution and ad sales to well-funded tech giants and refocusing on what they do best: reporting the news.â€�But two years after it launched, a platform that aspired to build a more stable path forward for journalism appears to be declining in relevance. At the same time that Instant Articles were being designed, Facebook was beginning work on the projects that would ultimately undermine it. Starting in 2015, the company's algorithms began favoring video over other content types, diminishing the reach of Instant Articles in the feed. The following year, Facebook's News Feed deprioritized article links in favor of posts from friends and family. The arrival this month of ephemeral stories on top of the News Feed further de-emphasized the links on which many publishers have come to depend.In discussions with Facebook executives, former employees, publishers, and industry observers, a portrait emerges of a product that never lived up to the expectations of the social media giant, or media companies. After scrambling to rebuild their workflows around Instant Articles, large publishers were left with a system that failed to grow audiences or revenues. Facebook says the adoption of Instant Articles is growing quickly, and that upcoming changes to the platform will lure back some of the major media companies that have abandoned it. But given Facebookâ€™s other priorities, the future of Instant Articles is less certain than ever.Instant Articles went live on May 13th, 2015, with tools that included 3D maps, audio captions for images, and photos that moved based on the position of the phone in your hand. Publishers abandoned those tools almost immediately, instead focusing on the formatâ€™s ability to solve an increasingly pressing problem: attracting and retaining readers. The early signs were hopeful â€” readers liked Instant Articlesâ€™ faster loading times, and they rewarded them with more of their clicks.Instant Articles was built from the raw materials of Paper, a newsreading app Facebook released on iOS in early 2014. A bold reimagining of the company's flagship app, Paper offered users customizable sections including politics, technology, and food. (The News Feed was there, too â€” and without any ads.)Paper was a hit with critics â€” but not with Facebook's core user base, and it was ultimately shuttered last year.  Mike Matas, whose design firm Push Pop Press was acquired by Facebook in 2011, had been responsible for its unique look and feel, and he was tasked with designing Instant Articles.Though the format would have important financial consequences for the companies who used it, generating revenue for publishers was not a primary goal in its development. ""The team is legitimately motivated by making great articles,"" Matas told me in 2015. One former employee familiar with the matter said media companies' business models had initially been all but an afterthought. ""The idea that these products could meaningfully impact the revenue of the news industry just didnâ€™t really come up,"" the former employee said. ""I donâ€™t know that anyone [at Facebook] took that piece all that seriously.""Fidji Simo, a vice president of product at Facebook who oversees news, video, and ads in the News Feed, disputed the idea that the company didnâ€™t take revenue seriously. About 80 percent of publishersâ€™ initial requests to the company involved direct ad sales, she said in an interview last week. Facebook agreed to the proposal: Publishers could keep 100 percent of the revenue of any ads they sold themselves, or 70 percent of the revenue if they wanted Facebook to sell the ads for them. At publishersâ€™ request, Facebook also included analytics tools so they could understand and track their audiences, and customization tools so they could make their articles look distinct from one another's. Publishers were drawn to the sheer enormity of Facebook's audience â€” but it was never clear, even then, how much of that audience Instant Articles would attractBut the build-first, monetize-later approach that Facebook takes in building so many of its own products made for an awkward fit at media companies, many of which were still reeling from the transition from print to the web, and were now losing their hard-won digital audiences to Facebook's News Feed. Publishers were drawn to the sheer enormity of Facebook's audience â€” but it was never clear, even then, how much of that audience Instant Articles would attract.Still, the optimism was real. ""This is a very exciting experiment,"" Declan Moore, chief media officer for National Geographic, told me in May 2015. National Geographic was one of nine publishers, including BuzzFeed and The New York Times, invited to be launch partners. Facebook was careful not to guarantee that publishers would see expanded reach from Instant Articles. But it seemed likely that Facebook would favor the instant links, given that the articles loaded up to 10 times faster and kept users glued to the company's flagship app. ""In the beginning, having access to Instant will provide a huge advantage over publications that donâ€™t,"" wrote John Herrman, whose Content Wars series in The Awl had warned publishers that Facebook would ultimately change the terms of any deal to benefit itself. ""Eventually, publishersâ€™ numbers will even out as competition increases.""But it's unclear if any huge advantage ever materialized. Facebook decided from the start that publishing a story using the Instant Articles format would not automatically improve its ranking in the News Feed. In practice, Instant Articles typically do reach more people, because people are more likely to read and share them. But as the format spread, competition increased, and any advantage to using Instant Articles was blunted within months. Given that Instant Articles were designed to carry less advertising than mobile web articles, broad reach was essential to ensure publishers would profit from the format. The reach just never arrived.Facebook did meet regularly with publishing partners, and gradually implemented their suggestions. ""We deeply believe that the only way to have publishers use Instant Articles is if this works for them,"" Will Cathcart, who oversaw Instant Articles at the time, told me on its first anniversary.As part of that effort, Facebook added more revenue-generating tools to the format. First it permitted more display ads then it implemented video ads then it introduced sponsored posts shared on the publishers' own feeds. But across a wide swath of major publishers, results have been uniformly weak. ""The revenue in no way backed up the amount of time that was being spent on it,"" says Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next. DCN is a trade group that represents many large publishers, including NBC, The New York Times, Conde Nast, ESPN, Slate, Business Insider, and Vox Media. (Vox Media owns The Verge.) At the end of last year, DCN surveyed its members on the financial performance of content published to third-party platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Google's AMP project. It found that not one publisher reported earning more money through Instant Articles than they did through their own properties. â€œWe make less money on Instant Articles than we do on mobile web, which is probably everyoneâ€™s experience,â€� said Bill Carey, director of audience development at Slate. And while Facebook reported that publishers using Instant Articles saw readers consuming 25 percent more content, most DCN members had seen no such increase.In a presentation at the Social Media Week conference in February, The Verge's audience engagement editor, Helen Havlak, presented a slide comparing views of traditional Verge links posted to Facebook to Verge Instant Articles as a percentage of overall Facebook traffic. It showed that article views from Facebook were essentially flat in 2016, with Instant Articles representing a larger share of that traffic over time. Viewed in this light, Instant Articles had simply replaced one kind of view with another, less profitable one.Facebook says that the stagnant traffic is a product of a growing marketplace, and attributes it to increasing competition â€” there are more posts than ever to read, while readersâ€™ time remains finite. Simo told me the company is building a tool that will show publishers how their articles would have performed if posted as traditional links rather than Instant Articles. (Spoiler: badly.) Were it not for Instant Articles, the company says, publisher traffic would likely have declined even more.This appears to have been by design. Even as it courted publishers for the Instant Articles program, other teams at Facebook were building the features that would gradually push it out of the limelight. Last June, AdWeek reported that publishers' posts were reaching 42 percent fewer people than they were previously. A few weeks later, Facebook confirmed that it had altered the News Feed algorithm, prioritizing posts from friends and family members over links shared by publishers.Facebook is building a tool that will show publishers how their articles would have performed if posted as traditional links rather than Instant Articles Another new priority soon emerged in the form of video. In September 2015, just four months after Instant Articles launched, Facebook's ad product lead said that â€�a year or two from now, we think Facebook will be mostly video."" A massive investment in live video followed, and a video tab was added to Facebook's flagship app. â€œI wouldnâ€™t be surprised if you fast-forward five years and most of the content that people see on Facebook and are sharing on a day-to-day basis is video,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg told BuzzFeed in April 2016.This month's arrival of Facebook stories, a rolling series of photo and video posts that disappear 24 hours after they're posted, pushed Instant Articles further down in the News Feed. And publishers can't use the Stories format even if they want to â€” they are currently enabled only for individual users. ""The camera is going to be the priority, not news and entertainment content,"" one former employee told me. ""That's just going to keep getting shoved down in the feed."" The company has all but confirmed this â€œthe camera is the new keyboardâ€� is a popular refrain on campus these days.Simo says that the News Feed is becoming more of a multimedia experience over time, and that Instant Articles â€” which support video â€” is part of that. â€œWe live in a world thatâ€™s multimedia, where you tell stories using a variety of formats. What weâ€™ve tried to do is bring these things together so publishers can tell stories that combine all of these things.â€�And so for publishers that do their journalism primarily by linking to text, the News Feed appears increasingly forbidding. ""I'd suggest that links in general have felt weird on Facebook for a long time,â€� Herrman, now writing for The New York Times, told me in an email. â€œIt's the most obviously dated part of an otherwise constantly modernized platform it's a big messy border with the web that produces a bunch of difficult and institutionally unusual problems.""            While big publishers have been largely disappointed with Instant Articles, the format is propagating quickly throughout Facebook. Since last year, when Facebook began letting anyone publish to the format, the number of publishers using Instant Articles grew 16 times, to 9,000 publishers, Simo said. (That figure has grown 27 percent this year alone.) And a quarter of all clicks to articles on Facebook are now to Instant Articles, Simo said â€” a number that has grown 50 percent in 2017.Itâ€™s easy to see why readers like Instant Articles (theyâ€™re fast and uncluttered). And itâ€™s easy to see why Facebook likes Instant Articles (they keep people on Facebook). But for big media companies, the format has looked like a bad bet. And after two years of experimenting with Instant Articles, many outlets appear to have had enough. The New York Times, which had been a launch partner for Instant Articles, abandoned the platform last fall. Vice News, Forbes, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, and Hearst publications are among the large publishers who have joined it in leaving. Since last year the number of publishers using Instant Articles grew 16 times, to 9,000 publishers Others are publishing a small handful of articles to the platform while pushing the majority of their readers to their own websites, including CNN, the New York Daily News, and The Wall Street Journal, according to an analysis published last month by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism. Conde Nast decided not to roll the format out company-wide after all but one of its test titles lost money on it, a company source told The Verge.Now publishers are turning their attention elsewhere. Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages project borrows elements from Instant Articles while giving publishers more control. (Publishers that use paywalls, such as the Times, can implement them in AMP but not Instant Articles.) Articles published through AMP remain part of the open web, which publishers generally prefer to Facebookâ€™s closed ecosystem, and Google has flooded AMP with traffic from search. Most importantly, it makes more money than Instant Articles. By February, it was serving 7 percent of all traffic to major US publishers.Publishers are also paying increasing attention to Apple News, which added push notifications as part of a redesign last year and now delivers significant traffic thanks to the fact that it comes pre-installed on hundreds of millions of devices.The team that built Instant Articles has moved on, too. Matas quit in February 2016. Michael Reckhow, the product manager who led development of the initial version, left for Uber a few months later. Reckhow has been replaced by Mona Chaudhuri, a well-regarded former vice president of product at Chartbeat, who joined Facebook last August. Chaudhuri led a listening tour of publishing executives in New York last fall, and Facebook says it is responding to their concerns.â€œAll of these publishers are very open to coming back to the table once we implement a lot of their feedback.â€�The biggest request: subscriptions. Publishers who rely on a membership model are pushing Facebook to effectively build a paywall inside Instant Articles. Subscribers could read Instant Articles just like any others, but others would be offered a chance to subscribe. â€œA lot of the frustrations you hear are business model frustrations, rather than the performance of their content on Facebook or otherwise,â€� Simo said. Facebook wouldnâ€™t comment on whether it is building such a system, but based on my discussions with publishers, it seems likely.  â€œWeâ€™re listening to the feedback and weâ€™re continuing to iterate,â€� Simo said. â€œAll of these publishers are very open to coming back to the table once we implement a lot of their feedback.â€� She added: â€œI want them to find value.â€�If Instant Articles canâ€™t build traffic or revenue, perhaps it can at least inspire loyalty in publishersâ€™ existing audiences. This month, Facebook added a module to Instant Articles allowing publishers to solicit newsletter signups or likes to their pages. In the future, Facebook says the module could be used to invite readers to install publishersâ€™ mobile apps or begin a trial subscription.Slateâ€™s Carey said the company has seen early success in attracting newsletters subscribers this way. The company is shifting away from a page view-driven business model to one that emphasizes reader loyalty. (Loyal readers are more likely to sign up for Slate Plus, its premium subscription product.) â€œFor us right now, the big question is whether we can bring more people back into the Slate audience, and make them Slate readers,â€� he said. The newsletter signup module has been a good start. â€œWeâ€™re hopeful that tools they have coming down the pike will be similarly helpful.â€�Neha Gandhi, senior vice president of content and strategy at Refinery29, told me Instant Articles â€œneither helps nor harmsâ€� the companyâ€™s efforts to build audiences through Facebook. The publisher remains part of the program so it can beta test new features, such as the newsletter modules. â€œThese are products that are testing building daily habit, increasing stories per session, and building loyalty â€” all of which are core priorities for Refinery29,â€� she said.Meanwhile, the News Feed is as unpredictable as ever. The ones who can afford to adapt to every new format Facebook introduces, hoping that, in aggregate, engaging with the platformâ€™s ecosystem will lead to profits. â€œItâ€™s the constellation of things that we have on Facebook,â€� said Mark Silverstein, who leads business development at The Huffington Post. The Huffington Post was the top publisher on Facebook in 2016, according to NewsWhip, embracing Instant Articles, live video, and video on demand. â€œConsumers are going to go where consumers go,â€� Silverstein said. â€œItâ€™s our job to meet them there.â€�Two years later, itâ€™s increasingly clear that Instant Articles wonâ€™t resolve publishersâ€™s anxieties about building sustainable businesses. But neither has it led to a cataclysm. Despite Instant Articleâ€™s middling results, Facebookâ€™s power over publishers seems stronger than ever. Where Facebook leads, publishers follow â€” from articles, to Instant Articles, to video, to live video, to ephemeral stories and beyond.â€œFacebook changed, and so did publishers,â€� Herrman said. â€œThe underlying dynamic didn't, at least not that much.â€�",2017.0,4.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

",2017-04-14,"      How a weapon against war became a weapon against the web Every year, artists and technology enthusiasts meet in Linz, Austria, for the Ars Electronica Festival, a meetup in the cityâ€™s downtown, located just off the Danube River. The festival is a haven for those with an eye toward the future â€” something between Burning Man and a TED conference, with visitors navigating scientific equipment, LED lights, and colorful installations. International visitors for the event are common enough, but the 1998 festival featured an unlikely participant: the Pentagon.That year, members of an art group called the Electronic Disturbance Theater were invited to demonstrate a program called FloodNet. Billed as a â€œvirtual sit-in,â€� users navigated to the FloodNet website at a predetermined time, and through a simple Java tool, were directed to a targeted website that would reload constantly, every few seconds. With enough people â€” perhaps thousands â€” the sit-in caused targeted websites to slow or maybe even crash, rendering them intermittently inaccessible.The ability to neutralize practically any website on demand...was a powerful new tool for global civic disobedienceThe group set three targets, picked in solidarity with Mexicoâ€™s Zapatista revolutionary movement and â€œagainst neoliberalism and the global economyâ€�: Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and what was then the site of the US Department of Defense, defenselink.mil. The group called its protests â€œactions,â€� and this action was called SWARM â€” Stop the War in Mexico.The ability to neutralize practically any website on demand â€” whatâ€™s now commonly referred to as a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack â€” was a powerful new tool for global civic disobedience. But for agencies like the Department of Defense, then facing the earliest prospects of war in the digital age, the capability posed a legitimate threat, and a dark omen of what was to come. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the groupâ€™s earliest beginnings, and the questions raised by Electronic Disturbance Theaterâ€™s actions are relevant in ways its creators could not have foreseen. Today the DDoS attack seems like a fait accompli of digital life: in October, a bot-powered DDoS attack shut down major sites around the internet â€” a caper that exposed the fragility of the internet, as the attack was soon classified as the largest of its kind ever observed.In a documentary from 2001, Ricardo Dominguez, EDTâ€™s bespectacled, wavy-haired ringleader, explains the groupâ€™s mission in the sober, scholarly diction of a determined revolutionary: â€œElectronic civil disobedience is non-violent direct action online.â€� EDTâ€™s precise ideological origins are murky, and not without some controversy. In the 1990s, a group called Critical Art Ensemble was formed in Tallahassee, Florida. Led by Steve and Hope Kurtz, a married couple, the group published two seminal texts in the history of digital protest: 1994â€™s The Electronic Disturbance and 1996â€™s Electronic Civil Disobedience and Other Unpopular Ideas. The texts anticipated a near-future when street protests, used to block physical space, would shift to blocking digital space â€” a radical idea for the time. Dominguez was a member of the group, although Steve Kurtz still disputes his contribution to the texts.EDT didnâ€™t patent the denial of service technique. As Molly Sauter documents in her book The Coming Swarm, an Italian hacker group called the Strano Network is often credited with the first major DDoS-like protest. In 1995, the Strano Network targeted French government sites with a one-hour â€œnet strikeâ€� after the government tested nukes in the Pacific Ocean â€” an action with limited success. But it was EDT, through high-profile demonstrations against governments and businesses, that first popularized the idea of politically driven DDoS attacks, creating the foundation that others would use well into the future.The incident that brought EDT together came in late 1997. The revolutionary Zapatista Army had rebelled for years against the Mexican government, and in December of that year, the violence came to a head when 45 people, including 15 children, were killed during an attack in the state of Chiapas, in a town sympathetic to the Zapatistas. The Zapatistasâ€™ leaders were clear on who they blamed: President Zedillo. He condemned the massacre, but surviving witnesses said the gunmen were allied with Zedilloâ€™s political party. ''The direct responsibility for this bloody event lies on the shoulders of Ernesto Zedillo and Interior Ministry officials who two years ago gave the green light for the Army to fight a counterinsurgency war in Chiapas,â€� the Zapatistas said in a communique. The attack brought EDTâ€™s members together under a common cause, and a lineup coalesced with four members: Brett Stalbaum and Carmin Karasic, two artists with technical expertise, formed the coding backbone of the group Dominguez and Stefan Wray, activists more interested in theory, were its philosophers. Dominguez and Wray, who were already involved in Zapatista solidarity efforts in the US, began to discuss the idea of an electronic civil disobedience action. Stalbaum wrote an early draft of what would become FloodNet, and worked with Karasic, who improved on the concept with him. EDT planned a series of actions for 1998, starting with a response to the Chiapas massacre. In April, Dominguez sent out a series of notes alerting people to the plan: ""FLOODNET: TACTICAL VERSION 1.0."" would target the website of President Zedillo, with the goal of bringing attention to the killings. The group bristles now at the idea it intended to bring down the site, but did foresee the possibility that access would be disrupted. â€œTruth not found Justice not found.â€� In one clever twist, the program even let users customize messages attached to their server requests, pinging for information like â€œtruthâ€� or â€œjustice.â€� In a stylistic flourish with little practical use in a pre-social media era, the users could send word- or phrase-related queries to the site, which would spit out errors in the server log: truth not found justice not found. The first action attempt that month, launched in a pair of two-hour stretches, brought in more than 8,000 individuals, EDT later claimed. The group received reports that, although it did not seem entirely disabled, the site was at times inaccessible. But the group saved its most organized action for the Ars festival, which Dominguez and Wray attended in person: a grand demonstration of FloodNet, once again targeting Zedilloâ€™s website, as well as the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Pentagon.The festival had always been a haven for the hacker counterculture, with icons like William Gibson making the journey to speak, and participants didnâ€™t shy away from the political: one prescient exhibit from 1998 featured a miniature border wall topped with security cameras. That year, the theme was information warfare, and EDT was invited to attend alongside prominent hackers, including groups like the Hippies From Hell, a radical Dutch collective that Dominguez says considered EDT â€œimpure.â€� He remembers offering the use of FloodNet to another group in exchange for some beer. As other attendees discussed theoretical ideas, EDT was eager to act. Their action was planned for the third day of the festival, and it drew considerable media attention. As usual, the group announced its plans in advance, conscious of the attention it might garner, but a sign of sabotage appeared early. That morning, Dominguez says, he received a threatening phone call from a Spanish speaker, who he claims said, We know who you are, but didnâ€™t reveal his identity. Dominguez believes it was â€œMexican agents,â€� although this hasnâ€™t been substantiated.                 A screenshot of the original FloodNet program. A full, working version of the program has been preserved by Rhizome, a non-profit dedicated to new media and digital art.  At 11AM Linz time, web users began flooding the sites. The hits poured in for hours â€” from Italy, Japan, Malaysia â€” even, it appeared, from servers associated with US education and military institutions. That afternoon, the group gave a talk on their work.But then something strange happened. â€œI looked at my desktop and noticed a string of Java icons â€” little coffee cups â€” streaming across the bottom of the screen,â€� Wray later wrote. â€œAnd then FloodNet just froze. I saw this happen on several machines.â€� Similar reports surfaced that some kind of error had halted the protest. â€œCountermeasures effectively kept me from participating this morning I'm wondering if you could give me an update on how things went,â€� one hopeful user messaged to the group. A small screenshot from the time preserved the error that appeared:Netscape is unable to locate the server: reload-your-search-page.please The server does not have a DNS entry. Check the server name in the Location (URL) and try again.The group couldnâ€™t have known what was happening, but Wray soon received a message that eventually provided some shocking clarity. The email was from an administrator at NYU, who said theyâ€™d been contacted by the Department of Defense, asking questions about EDT, which hosted a page with an EDT-related link on the universityâ€™s servers. The counterstrike shut down the action, and later that night, Stalbaum uncovered what he says now was â€œa kind of media combat weaponâ€� â€” a counter Java applet that appeared to be crashing machines loading the Pentagon pages. When he looked further, he found that it was named â€œHostile Applet.â€�The next day, Wired published a story on the incident, in which a Defense Department spokesperson obliquely took credit for shutting down the digital attack. â€œOur support personnel were aware of this planned electronic civil disobedience attack and were able to take appropriate countermeasures,â€� the spokesperson said.â€œMeasures were taken to send the countless demands [from the attackers] into the great beyond.â€�            The groupâ€™s actions continued throughout the year, as EDT expanded to target other websites, including the White House. By the end of the year, the group had drawn the attention of The New York Times. â€œRadical groups are discovering what hackers have always known: Traditional social institutions are more vulnerable in cyberspace than they are in the physical world,â€� a story on the group and other hacktivists read. Members of EDT tend to demur when asked about their role in popularizing DDoS attacks. As Karasic points out, the group differed from many hackers, who may take action against an entity unilaterally, without the support of like-minded internet users. FloodNet required participation from thousands to be effective â€” there was something akin to â€œa vote.â€� But the groupâ€™s most notable legacy may be a radical blurring of the line between provocative art and hacking. The group released a freely available version of FloodNet, which other activists could use to launch their own protests, just after midnight on New Yearâ€™s Eve 1998. The yearâ€™s actions completed, the members went their separate ways. In 2001, the airline Lufthansa was targeted by a different group, inspired by EDT, protesting deportations from Germany facilitated by the company. â€œ[EDTâ€™s members] were tangentially involved in literally every DDoS thing that happened in the early 2000s,â€� Sauter says.â€œEDTâ€™s members were tangentially involved in literally every DDoS thing that happened in the early 2000s.â€�About 13,000 people took part in the Lufthansa â€œsit-in,â€� and while the airline said it successfully withstood the attack, an organizer was arrested and charged. Eventually, he was ordered to pay a fine or serve three months in jail, Sauter explains, but another court overturned the ruling, saying the action was a justified form of protest. Parts of the commentariat, like the writer Evgeny Morozov, have since said that this is a reasonable legal interpretation â€” that it is possible to see such actions as a form of dissent â€” but the legal test that may one day decide these issues definitively in the United States still hasnâ€™t materialized.Meanwhile, both the technology powering activism and the cultural landscape behind it have changed dramatically since EDT was active. A small group can take down large parts of the internet without much help, but many continue to do so in the name of protest and art. Dominguez himself organized a digital â€œsit-inâ€� of hundreds of students targeting the University of California presidentâ€™s website to protest the institutionâ€™s financial policies. Dominguez was a UC San Diego professor, and still is, although the protest nearly cost him tenure. Stalbaum is also a professor at the university, and, although the group has mostly drifted apart, is now a part of Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0: a group with new members, if a similar mission. Carmin Karasic works as an artist in the Netherlands. Wray has lost touch with the group. Dominguez sees a fundamental difference between EDTâ€™s work and later activists that took up its cause as activists. â€œOur work may end up being useful to a wide variety of communities, but our approach was always as artists,â€� he says.â€œIt doesnâ€™t mean that weâ€™re not concerned with the political, weâ€™re not concerned with the conditions we find ourselves in,â€� he continues. â€œBut as artists weâ€™re not necessarily rapidly mobilized to hit Trump Tower now.â€�The distinction between art and protest might be lost on the groups using todayâ€™s version of EDTâ€™s tactics. In 2013, Anonymous supporters launched a White House petition to legalize DDoS attacks after a series of arrests related to politically motivated attacks launched by the group. The petitioners argued that a DDoS attack was free speech. â€œDistributed denial-of-service (DDoS), is not any form of hacking in any way,â€� the petition read. â€œIt is the equivalent of repeatedly hitting the refresh button on a webpage.â€� The idea had more than a small hint of EDT philosophy. The page for the petition has since been taken down. ",2017.0,4.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

",2017-03-30,"      Inside the big business of imagining the future In the Dubai of 2050, the world looks both instantly familiar and utterly strange. Here, urban planning is driven by an omniscient AI installed at the top of a skyscraper your smart bathroom mirror tracks your physical health and you interface with the government through a personalized â€œgenie,â€� a hologram in the form of a virtual Emirati gentleman in traditional garb. All of these future products are skinned in a particular visual aesthetic of friendly white-on-black animated icons like a minimalist, sentient version of Appleâ€™s iOS.This uncanny scene was on display at the United Arab Emiratesâ€™ second annual Government Summit, hosted in Dubai in February 2014. A three-day event comprised of dozens of speakers â€” including Sir Richard Branson â€” and over 4,000 participants, it bills itself as the â€œlargest annual government gathering in the world.â€� The gathering was meant to â€œbuild hope, build life and future, and make people happy,â€� said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, prime minister of the UAE and royal ruler of Dubai, during the event. The urban AI, hologram genie, and smart bathroom were part of the Museum of Future Government Services, a series of seamless interactive installations that demonstrated to attendees â€” Emirati politicians and civil servants, as well as foreign dignitaries and business leaders â€” how the UAE would serve its citizens several decades hence.The Museum of Future Government Services was created by Tellart, a technology-focused design agency, headquartered thousands of miles away in Rhode Island. Launched in 2000, Tellart now employs 38 individuals spread across offices in Providence, New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Dubai. The UAE government is one of the companyâ€™s largest clients the two entities collaborate on the Government Summit events and are developing a permanent Museum of the Future in Dubai.Of course, none of the products demonstrated at the 2014 summit actually existed. Rather, Tellartâ€™s job is to create believable, immersive visions of the future based on the needs of its clients, which range from the UAE to Google, Purina, and the California Academy of Sciences â€” anyone who needs a little bit of tomorrow today. As the companyâ€™s co-founder Nick Scappaticci says, â€œWe are the industrial designers of the 21st century.â€�                Photo: Tellart      Museum of the Future  Tellart is at the forefront of an industry that doesnâ€™t really have a name. What it does is sometimes labeled â€œdesign fiction,â€� a genre that might be defined as â€œprototypes that allow you to suspend your disbelief about the ways the world is changing around you,â€� says Alexander Porter, the co-founder of Scatter, a virtual reality storytelling studio in Brooklyn.Design fiction is created by a loose confederation of agencies, artists, engineers, and designers who are shaping our expectations of technology and society in decades to come by showing us what that incipient world might look like, down to its cliche brand logos. Itâ€™s science fiction made real in the form of interactive exhibitions, product demonstrations, and behind-the-scenes consulting work. And it tends to pop up at any event Davos-ish enough to include the word â€œinfluencers.â€� Alongside Tellart, the industry is made up of organizations like Barbarian Group, the now-defunct BERG London, Fake Love (acquired by The New York Times Company in August 2016), and Googleâ€™s Creative Lab. Even if youâ€™re unfamiliar with these names, itâ€™s likely youâ€™ve seen their handiwork in high-tech viral videos, like this rendering of a mundane living room turning into an immersive intergalactic VR video game, created by the studio Marshmallow Laser Feast for Sony Superfluxâ€™s 2011 â€œSong of the Machine,â€� a prophetic rendering of VR technology as seen through a walk in London or the Swiss Federal Institute of Technologyâ€™s miniature quadcopters caught assembling a rope bridge in midair.  Lesser future design fiction projects resemble mediocre advertising, the detritus of CES or the fever dreams of a self-styled futurist like AOLâ€™s Shingy. It can be as basic as a drone that takes selfies or a 3D burrito printer. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of stuff that almost exists to chase the Fast Company headline,â€� says Colin James Nagy, Barbarian Groupâ€™s former chief of media and strategy. Yet however reductive, these design miniatures still help form our idea of what the future can be.â€œIt's really easy to freak people out with science fiction. It's a heavy responsibility,â€� says Tellart co-founder Matt Cottam when I first meet him and Scappaticci at the companyâ€™s New York outpost, located in the corner of a Chelsea loft. He cites a maxim from the author and New School sociology instructor Barbara Adams: â€œEvery act of future making is an act of future taking."" Cottam continues, â€œWhile creating a high fidelity image of the future may broaden people's imagination for what's possible, it can also really narrow their perception of what's possible or what their options are.â€�He cites a potent example: one Museum of Future Government Services installation involved handing guests warm towels in the way an upscale hotel might. After the guests gave the towels back to attendants, they were scanned for biometric data to determine visitorsâ€™ identities and backgrounds. A screen displayed a visualization of their bodies and whether or not any dangerous communicable diseases were found. â€œEvery act of future making is an act of future taking.""After passing through, one pregnant Emirati woman came to Cottam worried that the scan might have impacted her baby. â€œI was like, â€˜That scanner was a Microsoft Kinect and a projector,â€™â€� Cottam says, no more harmful than playing a video game. Although no actual biometric data scan happened, the experience left the attendee feeling that the technology was invasive and dystopian.While predicting the future is an eternal pursuit, rendering it experiential is a more modern innovation. The 1939 Worldâ€™s Fair, with its theme of â€œThe World of Tomorrow,â€� included Futurama, an exhibit sponsored by the General Motors Corporation and designed by the industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes. Its major forecast was a highway system connecting the entire country, and its rendering of a city block, with clean glass-and-steel buildings rising above a street crowded with cars, has been borne out by history, though not always in a positive sense the installationâ€™s â€œsuper highway of tomorrowâ€� looks like the worst parts of the New Jersey Turnpike today.Data-driven future prediction emerged around 1948 with the launch of RAND Corporation. The nonprofit think tankâ€™s â€œscenario analysisâ€� practice connected military planning with private technology development. RANDâ€™s tactics were adopted by Shell in the 1970s, creating a precedent for the corporate future-consulting we see today.                 Photo: Tellart      Museum of the Future  In the 1960s, media, art, technology, and advertising seemed to resonate at the same countercultural pitch: television, Mad Men firms, Andy Warhol, LSD. â€œAt the edges of those things they started to blend together,â€� says Samantha Culp, the co-founder of Paloma Powers, a small agency that works with visual artists, often incorporating technology. The blending was furthered with initiatives like Experiments in Art and Technology and the Los Angeles County Museum of Artâ€™s Art and Technology Program, which launched in 1966 and â€˜67, bringing visual artists like Robert Rauschenberg into contact with engineers from Bell Labs.While the nexus of art and technology was already established, future design agencies didnâ€™t emerge in earnest until the 1990s, when once again the aesthetics of one avant-garde field could be conveniently applied to another. With the advent of multimedia-capable computers, it became easier for artists and designers to work with digital technology and demand for their services grew from companies who wanted to look progressive in the internet era.1991 saw the launch of IDEO, known for helping companies develop new products the Dutch conceptual design group Droog was founded in 1993 digital-savvy ad makers Blast Radius and Mother in 1996 Tellart in 2000 and Barbarian Group in 2001. Younger competitors like Superflux, Red Paper Heart, Midnight Commercial, and Marshmallow Laser Feast arose in the 2010s.The agencies are paid to adapt unstable emerging technologies to marketing and branding efforts, and in the process normalize and commodify them for a mainstream audience. If you see facial recognition technology at the Museum of Future Government Services, for example, then you might not be so shocked when it actually shows up in airport security. The experiential fiction acclimatizes you to the future in advance.Today, artists and designers do residencies at Google or Microsoft as easily as a museum. This year, Nokia Bell Labs is partnering with the New Museum to fund a new art-technology residency program. â€œThereâ€™s an ongoing relationship between creative and industrial complexes,â€� says Kyle McDonald, a Los Angeles-based artist whose work both critiques and participates in the tech world (McDonald has collaborated with Microsoft Research and Google Creative Lab). The conjunction of art, technological innovation, and marketing presents a quandary for tech-fluent creatives: do you soldier on with your own independent work or do you manufacture varying degrees of future propaganda for corporations and governments? The latter often subsidizes the former as artists and corporations work, together and apart, to establish a mainstream futuristic aesthetic.                Photo: Tellart      Museum of the Future  I arrive at Tellartâ€™s Providence office, an airy exposed-brick loft in an old warehouse on the outskirts of downtown, on the morning of November 9th. Much of the staff appears to be in a deep post-election hangover. Even a group of committed futurists struggle when the supposedly inevitable immediate future seems to have collapsed.Once a week, the company holds an all-hands meeting over Google Hangouts with the offices videoconferencing in from their various time zones: morning in the US, happy hour in Amsterdam, night in Dubai. â€œWeâ€™re all going to be fine here at Tellart,â€� co-founder Nick Scappaticci reassures after a brief discussion, sitting with the Providence team on sleek armchairs and a couch arranged around a TV. The nationalism embodied by a Trump win seems anathema to such a post-national crowd.Matt Cottam, who is based in Amsterdam with his Italian wife, was absent from the virtual meeting. The 43-year-old Cottamâ€™s predilection for well-cut shirts and the tendency to extend an â€œsâ€� into a â€œzâ€� in an unplaceable internationalist accent marks him as an American Europhile. Scappaticci, 38, who lives in Providence and runs the office there, is softer-spoken, a fatherly figure dressed in plaid and a pair of circular glasses: a sort of techno-lumberjack.Even a group of committed futurists struggle when the supposedly inevitable immediate future seems to have collapsedCottam and Scappaticci met as industrial design students at the Rhode Island School of Design where they formed a group studio with friends working in furniture, graphic design, and filmmaking. â€œWe were at the start of how computers could really be a part of the design process as a tool,â€� Cottam recalls. Their industry was changing. This was the original dot-com era, and designers were taking highly respected jobs in Silicon Valley for big paychecks. Then the bubble popped. â€œIn some ways that was a real blessing because any temptation to go off and just take a really high-paying job was gone,â€� Cottam says. â€œWe decided to create a studio that would natively combine the physical and the digital.â€�At the meeting, employees discuss their projects, ranging from an interactive installation for Purina to building out a digital app for an architecture institution, to testing projection-mapping software on plants. A project called Deep Future, composed of star charts projected out at 10,000-year intervals printed in beeswax by a robot on dyed cotton, has to be installed at the Museum of Tomorrow in Rio de Janeiro.Tellart works on fewer than a dozen projects at any one time, though that number has been steadily rising. Most of the companyâ€™s billing is experiential exhibitions, then product development and advertising campaigns, in which they often lend technical expertise to larger agencies. Budgets range from $100,000 for smaller installations to $3 million for the likes of the UAE projects the vast majority are completed in less than a year. The company says their annual revenue is around $6 to $8 million.What sets Tellart apart from bigger, more traditional creative agencies is that it functions more like a Renaissance artist studio or starchitecture firm â€” a collective of individual artists and engineers cooperating to create a body of work under a single label. The company takes on commissions, but each project is of a piece with the rest, united by a particular style and approach driven by its founders.                Photo: Tellart      Museum of the Future  Cottam and Scappaticci refer to human-centered design, a conceptual framework popular with IDEO and other studios. But unlike designing a better toilet plunger by focusing on its user, Tellart first envisions a future to design for. â€œIs this is a world where collapse happened, or a world where transformation happened, or growth?â€� Cottam asks. Clients might pose a product or a problem, but Tellart brings in teams of outside consultants, from architects to futurists and sci-fi novelists, for world-building and selecting a relevant situation to simulate. Youâ€™re dealing with a robo-nurse at the emergency room of an automated hospital, say, or your self-driving car is running late to work and has to dodge traffic. Finally thereâ€™s the physical stuff, the kitsch and junk of the future that make the theoretical world realistic and give visitors cues on how to behave in it. Every detail must be considered. Each Tellart project comes with a holistic narrative â€” the companyâ€™s name is shortened from â€œthe art of storytellingâ€� â€” and the story is a vital part of getting participants to believe in the vision. Design fiction often â€œtakes this somewhat easy path of creating these ironic, dystopian situations where technology is buggy and glitchy. The worst is this kind of hipster mundane future,â€� Cottam says. â€œI get into my car and it's supposed to use face recognition on me to know who I am. But I didn't put on my makeup so it doesn't know who I am.â€� The everyday malfunction makes the future seem realistic â€” just as haphazard as the present â€” but the proposition isnâ€™t particularly meaningful.Tellartâ€™s early work falls into the â€œhipster mundane futureâ€� category. â€œThe Real Good Experimentâ€� for Blu Dot in 2009 imagined a high-end chair tracking you with mobile GPS (netting over 200 million media impressions). In 2011, the Love Song Machine let users whack brightly colored bells installed in the Tellart office live over the internet (more than 5,000 tunes were played, including one troll who hit a single note incessantly).The Google Web Lab in 2012 proved a turning point. Tellart created a series of interactive technological follies set in geometric white boxes, a kind of friendly robot zoo that was installed at the London Science Museum. The project showcased the internetâ€™s new capability for real-time multimedia interaction through the lens of Google Chrome. Via the website, users could play a live mechanical orchestra installed in the museum. Visitors to the space had their portraits drawn in sand by robot arms, gazed into 360-degree cameras live-streaming from exotic locales like an undersea kelp forest, and watched data server routes visualized on a projection-mapped sculpture of the continents. Produced with Googleâ€™s in-house Creative Lab as well as partners including Universal Design Studio, B-Reel, and MAP Project Office, the Web Lab was more like a pop-up techno-carnival than an actual product ecosystem. But it burnished the reputations of everyone involved, winning design awards and bringing half a million visitors to the museum.More clients came knocking, including the UAE. Noah Raford, an MIT PhD who is now the chief operating officer of the governmentâ€™s Dubai Future Foundation â€” the Shingy of the Emirates â€” was tipped off to Tellart by a mutual friend of his and Matt Cottamâ€™s who was stationed at Fabrica, Benetton Groupâ€™s internal research center and another node in the future design industry. Raford brought Tellart to the 2014 Government Summit, and the firm has taken on a larger role each successive year, he says. They translate policy proposals into digestible future-theater.They translate policy proposals into digestible future-theaterWorking in the UAE means that certain cultural specificities must be designed around. VR goggles have to avoid mussing headscarves and hallways need to be wide enough for men and women to pass each other by easily. The future looks different in different parts of the world. In Western countries, â€œwe currently have super minimalistic aesthetics,â€� says Zaza Zuilhof, Tellartâ€™s lead designer. In the Middle East, â€œthey are generally a bit more decorative. They care about things feeling and looking luxurious.â€� Having no nostalgia for Industrial Revolution chic, the usual hipster-mundane-future palette of concrete, wood, and rusty metal â€œjust feels like a building site,â€� Zuilhof adds. The 2015 Museum of the Future theme was Smart Cities. It included Fitzania, a fitness game that equipped the player with a heavy metal sphere and plunged them into a psychedelic dot-matrix environment controlled by face recognition the PharmaCafe, with (fake) custom medical therapies turned into misted cocktails and the Learning Lab, an interactive immersive projection of a Mars colony staffed by employees from UAEâ€™s actual space program. â€œMachinic Lifeâ€� in 2016 featured cartoon AI home caretakers, a â€œUAE HyperMindâ€� superintelligence that manages society, and an exhibition of body augmentation devices. The visual language that Tellart has invented for future-Dubai has stayed consistent across the years: a certain plush, high-gloss transparency that forbids hard edges and harsh colors. The result is a soothing environment in which technology is almost always your friend.The future-facing partnership with Tellart is a strategic one for UAE, a country that since the 1970s has based its economy on oil proceeds. It needs a new national industry, and technology is one marketable option. The Dubai Future Foundation also includes the Dubai Future Accelerator, an international startup lab with a tagline that might provide a manifesto: â€œPulling the future forward faster.â€� In this context, the services of a company like Tellart are vital in helping the country brand itself as, well, futuristic. So vital, in fact, that plans have been in the works to start a joint agency company between the UAE and Tellart that will be based in Dubai, serving the national government as well as clients in the rest of the region as they, too, fashion their own futures.                 Photo: Tellart      Museum of the Future  UAEâ€™s self-conscious utopianism has been labeled â€œGulf Futurism.â€� It can be seen as the deployment of technology in â€œthe proto-fascism of a society that privileges success and speed over human life,â€� as the Dubai and Brooklyn-based writer Rahel Aima put it in a 2013 interview. Working with a client that pays its royal families annual allowances while abusing the migrant workers who build its infrastructure, as Human Rights Watch reports allege, is a fraught decision. Making work under the specifications of such governments, Cottam says, is inherently political, â€œwhether we like it or not.â€�Working in the future industry thus â€œbecomes self-selecting. Who is willing to be ideologically neutral?â€� says Samantha Culp. Itâ€™s a reminder that the international artists and technologists creating our popular ideas of the future do so in contexts shaped by the pursuit of profit or power. If you can render the future in advance, after all, maybe you can also control it.     The 2017 World Government Summit ran from February 12thâ€“14th. Speakers included the research director of Y Combinator, the president of the World Bank, the prime minister of Slovenia, and LinkedInâ€™s Reid Hoffman. In his WGS presentation, Elon Musk argued that in order to survive the mounting tide of artificial intelligence, humanity must merge with technology: â€œThere will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot canâ€™t do better.â€� This year, Tellartâ€™s Museum of the Future took on the pressing issue of the environment, casting it in the techno-utopian light that future fiction is known for. â€œThe goal was to reimagine climate change and look at it as one of the biggest and most exciting opportunities of our generation,â€� Scappaticci told me after the event had ended. The installations followed three concerns: food, water, and the urban environment. How will cities of the future react to agricultural scarcity, access to clean water, and rampant flooding?                Photo: Tellart      Museum of the Future  In Tellartâ€™s imagined future, the UAE of 2050 has it covered. In the projection, Emirati scientists combine the genes of jellyfish with mangrove roots, one of natureâ€™s best desalinators, to create an â€œorganic filtration plant that allows you to produce drinkable water out of the ocean,â€� Scappaticci explains. Visitors experienced the plant, a biomorphic alien structure fit for the new Star Wars, on a 360-degree video screen with immersive sound and temperature changes.Presented in a room flush with greenery, future food comes from AI-driven farms that occupy the garages and parking lots left empty by self-driving cars. Seeds are bioengineered and â€œprintedâ€� to optimize for nutritional value. Dubai visitors taste-tested the results with edible cubes made of sustainable foodstuffs like beetroot and crickets, delivered by conveyor belt. Elsewhere in the 2017 Museum of the Future, â€œself-sufficientâ€� dynamic cities could be â€œdeployedâ€� and â€œgrownâ€� using City Kits, simulated on-screen by interactive virtual robots in digital landscapes.The idealized narrative that Tellart created is meant to comfort one of the wealthiest and yet most ecologically imperiled regions The idealized narrative that Tellart created is meant to comfort one of the wealthiest and yet most ecologically imperiled regions in the world. In this future, the money from oil has solved all the problems that oil dependency creates â€” thanks to technology, the desert becomes a permanent oasis. Tellartâ€™s work reassures its viewers that the environment is an issue that will simply be fixed one day, through no effort on their part, save perhaps cultivating a taste for bugs. Yet there is no guarantee this future will come to pass, and no vision for it spreading to less prosperous parts of the world.Having set expectations, this future fiction is meant to eventually blur into reality. UAE is â€œusing applied futures as a way to drive their governmentâ€™s vision,â€� Scappaticci says, not just through the Dubai Future Foundation but across levels and departments. At the end of the exhibition, Tellart included a survey that asked the attendants which environmental challenge was most pressing and what technology should be used to confront it, in an attempt to gauge the anxieties of a nation.The 2017 exhibition was a â€œreframing of climate change so itâ€™s not seen as something that we canâ€™t get control of, thatâ€™s beyond our capabilities,â€� Scappaticci says. â€œHereâ€™s a version of our future in which weâ€™ve come together, weâ€™ve solved these problems, and weâ€™re more in harmony with the world,â€� presenting the possibility of a solution so we donâ€™t have to, say, give up and move to Mars. Tellartâ€™s boutique futurism is ultimately an optimistic one, motivated by a belief that, with funding from its clients, we can tweak the incipient future simply by envisioning it.",2017.0,3.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

",2017-03-28,"      Legal threats and disgruntled clients: inside the â€˜Uber for private jetsâ€™ Tim Martz made his fortune in broadcast radio, but even as a wealthy man, the price of chartering a private jet always stung a bit. So when Martz joined JetSmarter in February 2015, the service seemed like a steal. In return for a $7,000 annual membership fee, plus a $2,000 initiation charge, he could use the companyâ€™s mobile app to reserve flights on a private jet as often as he wanted. â€œYou got the whole plane to yourself, which is great,â€� recalls Martz. He flew a half-dozen times in his first six months, taking trips from his Denver home to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and various vacation paradises. â€œIâ€™m paying this amount of money and getting $15,000 flights for free, thatâ€™s a good deal.â€�Over the last two years, JetSmarter has earned a reputation as a fast-growing startup with a luxury product and investors to match. In December 2016, Shawn â€œJay Zâ€� Carter and the Saudi royal family led a $105 million round of funding that valued the company at $1.5 billion, putting it in the coveted Unicorn Club. Kim Kardashian declared she was â€œobsessedâ€� with the service, and rapper Rick Ross worked the company into his lyrics. JetSmarter added big names like Tom Ridge, a former director of Homeland Security, to its board. Florida governor Rick Scott was on hand to dedicate its new office in downtown Fort Lauderdale. Kim Kardashian declared she was â€œobsessedâ€� with the service, and rapper Rick Ross worked the company into his lyricsâ€œOur aim is to make flying private accessible to the masses,â€� said CEO Sergey Petrossov in an interview with Haute Living. Or at least that portion of the masses for whom business class was not enough but owning a Gulfstream was out of reach. The companyâ€™s marketing materials held out the promise that the moderately wealthy could mingle with celebrities and titans of industry. â€œAmong the handful of people flying with you â€“ this month alone flyers have included Jaime Foxx, mega-model Emily Ratajkowski (who flew from NY-LA), Super model Irina Shayk, SI model Chanel Iman, athletes, moguls and more,â€� read one pitch to potential members. â€œNetwork with other members and make friendships that matter.â€� The media took to calling it the â€œUber for private jets.â€�But while the company was accumulating the trappings of success, members began experiencing increasing turbulence. Starting in 2016, the benefits and costs associated with the membership began to change rapidly. Perks like free helicopter rides to the airport were removed from the membership offering. Meals, which had been free, started to cost hundreds of dollars, and travel around the holidays cost extra, too. Members lost the ability to reserve the entire plane without paying more. Martz decided not to renew: â€œAs my wife says, well if I have to share the plane, itâ€™s not really private, is it?â€�In a WhatsApp group created by members to converse, customers complained about the cutbacks. â€œWe know we get great value and we also know that the company has to grow, but to continually change the deliverables during our paid membership is unfair,â€� wrote one member who is still with the service. â€œBottom line you canâ€™t change what I paid for, period,â€� wrote another member. â€œIf I pay again and renew, Iâ€™m not guaranteed for what I paid? Thatâ€™s wild.â€� Many speculated that the tweaks to the service were symptoms of larger struggles at the business. â€œRide it while you can. When it implodes we all got our moneyâ€™s worth,â€� wrote one member. â€œI'm starting to feel like I'm involved in an elaborate private jet ponzi scheme, where instead of money, I receive flights,â€� wrote another.In other circumstances, JetSmarterâ€™s well-heeled clientele might be quick to complain publicly about perceived shortcomings. But the JetSmarter membership agreement includes a non-disparagement clause that allows JetSmarter to terminate anyone who makes negative or disparaging comments about the company or its employees. The Verge spoke with more than two dozen current and former customers and reviewed chat logs of conversations between another two dozen members. Some members claimed that their memberships were not renewed because they complained publicly about the service, and many others said they were afraid to voice their honest opinion, even in private chat rooms.     Effortless effervescence. |  : @abunin A post shared by JetSmarter (@jetsmarter) on Mar 12, 2017 at 8:29am PDTOne member contacted The Verge with a story about a legal battle that broke out when JetSmarter tried to raise their membership fees. â€œThey were pushing us around. It felt like I was dealing with the mafia,â€� the member said. The member was initially on the record, but reached out a day later to say they had changed their mind. â€œI don't wanna mess with JetSmarter, they have a big reach.â€� The companyâ€™s reputation took a hit last month, when its President, Edward Barsky, was arrested on charges of embezzlement. JetSmarter says the case stems from a previous job and is unrelated to its business.The non-disparagement clause isnâ€™t the only example of aggressive image control from the company. Earlier this month, JetSmarter pitched The Verge on a demonstration of their service, with the condition that if a positive report wasnâ€™t published within five business days, the reporter would be charged $2,000. Over the phone, JetSmarter CEO Petrossov and Ronn Torossian, the companyâ€™s chief business officer, acknowledged that the service was rapidly evolving. â€œItâ€™s a fast-growing technology company that makes changes,â€� said Torossian. â€œThere are some people, primarily those who joined two years ago, who might not be a fit for the company today.â€� The challenge, said Petrossov, is â€œhow do we pair luxury exclusivity with the sharing economy? There are growing pains and itâ€™s not right for everybody, I agree.â€� Torossian, a famously rough-and-tumble PR executive whose reputation as the bad boy of buzz previously earned him regular coverage on Gawker and elsewhere, was dismissive of the complaints. â€œThese are wealthy people, this isnâ€™t some mass-market gym youâ€™re paying $12 a month for,â€� said Torossian. â€œMillionaires and wealthy people canâ€™t bring food on the plane or pay for food on the plane? Itâ€™s a little bit insane.â€� The private airline industry presents a tempting target for entrepreneurs and investors. â€œItâ€™s a really beguiling market, because there is just so much waste,â€� says Bill Gurley, a veteran tech investor who backed Uber and sits on its board. â€œFor a startup, that is a huge opportunity.â€� Many private jets fly just 200 to 300 hours a year, while commercial airlines can fly well over 2,000. And according to Clive Jackson, the CEO and founder of global charter startup Victor, â€œA significant percentage of private jets in the air are flying empty.â€� A plane chartered from New York to Miami, for example, will often need to head back to base or relocate for its next pickup. This trip â€” known in the industry as the empty leg, deadhead, or repo â€” still requires an expensive amount of fuel, crew, and maintenance. â€œMany in the world of private aviation are fixated by how best to utilize these empty legs,â€� says Jackson. The dream is to build a marketplace to match empty legs with consumer demand.             JetSmarter launched in 2012, and in its early days its business was built around these empty legs. JetSmarter got paid by its members, its members got a deal on a flight, and the charter operator had a passenger to defray the cost of its deadhead. But while empty legs were a bargain, they had limited appeal. You needed a very specific kind of customer, one who would decide on short notice to drop everything and jet off to a destination without knowing exactly how they would get back. Whatâ€™s more, JetSmarter had little control over the planeâ€™s itinerary. If the jetâ€™s owner decided to delay their flight for an extra day of golf, then JetSmarterâ€™s members would also be delayed. â€œIf heâ€™s gonna make money as a business, itâ€™s not going to be by monetizing empty legs,â€� says Bradley Stewart, CEO of XOJet, which sells this type of flight to JetSmarter. So beginning in 2015, the company started adding some reliable inventory of its own. JetSmarter created a shuttle service between hot spots like New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, on which members could book seats for free. Members can also pay to create a shuttle at the date and time of their choosing. They get a seat on a luxury jet, on their schedule, but at a fraction of the cost of renting the whole plane or buying an ownership stake. The only catch is they have to share: once a member creates a shuttle, the remainder of the seats are offered free to other members.Big shout out 2 @JetSmarter who made my life so much easier this wk. Love this APP,the only way 2 book private jets. pic.twitter.com/Wwb1sf4sSJâ€” Fergie (@Fergie) May 30, 2016A lot of JetSmarter members loved the new offering. Steven Budker, an entrepreneur running a medical device company, says he flies over 100 times a year, and estimates heâ€™s paying about $450 a trip, a great price for a seat on a fancy jet. He also gets to skip the hassle of jostling among a crowd of strangers working their way through security, baggage claim, and boarding. Budker liked the service so much he purchased additional memberships as gifts for his father, daughter, even the designer helping to remodel his house. The company says the average member spends $29,000 a year on the service, and claims it has 8,000 members, figures that add up to $232 million in annual revenue. Adding shuttle service, however, dramatically changed the companyâ€™s cost structure. Unlike empty legs, JetSmarter had to rent these planes at a price not very different from an ordinary customer chartering a private jet. While it could secure empty legs for as little as $300 an hour, the cost to rent scheduled charter service on a jet runs between $5,000 and $15,000 an hour. JetSmarter says it now runs over 200 shuttle flights a week. If the average flight was two and half hours and cost $10,000 an hour, JetSmarterâ€™s shuttle program would cost $260 million a year.The company claims that it has been able to secure jets at a price dramatically lower than its competitors. â€œWeâ€™ve really cracked the code as to how to optimize usage, build up demand quickly, and aggregate supply very cost-efficiently,â€� says Petrossov. But JetSmarterâ€™s own suppliers seem to contradict that claim. Jet Linx, a fleet operator that charters planes to JetSmarter, is a big fan of the company. â€œI think itâ€™s fantastic,â€� said CEO Jamie Walker. â€œWeâ€™re bullish to see them continue to improve and gain more marketshare.â€� But for shuttle rentals, Walker says, â€œThey pay us just like a jet card client calling us and booking the flight.â€� XOJet told the same story. â€œHe pays full rate for shuttle,â€� said the CEO, though he added that XOJet would work with JetSmarter â€œon the margin, maybe 10â€“15 percent.â€� None of the suppliers contacted by The Verge suggested they were offering JetSmarter regular, deeply discounted fares on shuttle flights. And all agreed that very few of their empty legs, if any, could be used for shuttle service. The rising costs of running the service were reflected in the membership pricing. Though the company continues to offer an empty-legs-only membership for $5,000, between 2015 and 2017, the cost of an all-inclusive annual membership went from $7,000 to $15,000. The company also introduced an upper tier with extra benefits for $45,000 per year. JetSmarter projected the lifestyle of a country club, but their shifting price and perk structure moved with the speed of a Silicon Valley startup.There are plenty of successful tech companies that havenâ€™t achieved profitability: Uber has achieved a tremendous valuation despite its huge losses, and Snapchat just went public with a balance sheet that sports more red ink each quarter. â€œTheyâ€™re the digital online airplane version of Uber. A lot of these high-growth, concept business backed by venture capital are certainly burning cash,â€� said XOJetâ€™s Stewart. â€œThere is no doubt JetSmarter is one of them. The question is do they get to profitability within six months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months? If so, theyâ€™re off to the races. If not, who knows what happens.â€� â€œThey are trying to get to some light at the end of the tunnel in terms of profitability, but itâ€™s not going to happen.â€�JetSmarterâ€™s competitors paint a darker picture. They say that its claims on cost are ludicrous, that the company must be sustaining heavy losses, and is staying aloft through a combination of new members and venture capital. The recent cutbacks and changes to the service, they argue, are an effort to control costs. â€œThey are trying to get to some light at the end of the tunnel in terms of profitability, but itâ€™s not going to happen,â€� argues Peter Maestrales, the founder of Airstream Jets, a private charter company. On his company blog, Maestrales published a pair of articles arguing that JetSmarter was a â€œponzi scheme.â€� In response, JetSmarter threatened him with a defamation lawsuit, claiming it would file in three days if he didnâ€™t take the post down. Three weeks later, the company still hadnâ€™t filed suit. Instead, Maestrales says Petrossov called him repeatedly, begging him to take down the blog post, and offering up the potential of a business partnership. He is not the only person the company has attempted to silence through its legal department.  A former JetSmarter member, who asked The Verge not to use his name, signed up for the service in the fall of 2015. He travels frequently for business, and felt it â€œwas a great deal.â€� But from the very start, he was bothered by the ever-changing terms. â€œIâ€™m one of those guys, if I spend the money for a membership, I donâ€™t like the bait and switch.â€�As he considered whether or not to renew his membership, he joined a private chat room where JetSmarter members exchanged travel tips and coordinated around shared charter bookings. â€œI was bitching. Some members private messaged me saying they feel the same way,â€� he said with a laugh. â€œOne of my buddies said, â€˜Be careful in that chat room.â€™ I didnâ€™t know what he was talking about.â€� â€œOne of my buddies said, â€˜Be careful in that chat room.â€™ I didnâ€™t know what he was talking about.â€�When the member tried to renew his membership a few days later, he was denied. The company offered him no explanation for this decision. A second member shared a similar experience about losing their membership after complaining publicly. JetSmarter declined to share any details on the record about the decision to reject members. Other cases demonstrated the challenges of balancing the entitlement of JetSmarterâ€™s clients, and their sometimes boorish behavior, with effectively running a shared consumer service. Two members say they were unjustly kicked off for complaining about the company, though they committed offenses that wouldâ€™ve drawn censure anywhere. One source says he was booted for a critical Instagram post made by his brother on a flight they took together, though the companyâ€™s termination letter says that the post was racially tinged and invaded the privacy of other passengers. Another member initially said he was kicked out for complaining about the service, but later acknowledged that someone at the company told him the reason for his cancellation was lewd comments heâ€™d made on a flight. â€œThey are using the excuse that my problem is I was talking too loud about fucking some girls,â€� he complained bitterly. â€œItâ€™s a private jet. I can say whatever I want.â€� JetSmarter declined to comment to The Verge on revoking his membership.In a WhatsApp group chat, one person offered counsel to members, and a warning. â€œIf you donâ€™t like them, donâ€™t renew with them... by the way, if management would see what you guys write hereâ€¦ you would not be renewed. FYI.â€� People in the group half-joked that they would be reported as the top â€œcomplainers.â€� Several members said that they believed JetSmarter employees, masquerading as customers, were reporting on users, forcing customers to abandon the chat rooms and create new ones. One of the most vocal defenders of the company in the group chat had an area code from South Florida, where JetSmarter is based. As one person in the group put it in an interview, many worried that someone was â€œjust going to take notes and turn you in.â€�In interviews, members specifically cited the non-disparagement clause as a source of concern. One former customer told The Verge that if he hadn't already declined to renew his membership, ""essentially, I wouldnâ€™t have this conversation with you.â€� One member believed the clause might not be legal, but decided not to bring it up with JetSmarter, as he worried he wouldnâ€™t be renewed if the company thought he was â€œa troublemaker.â€� In a separate chat thread, a current member who has renewed the service and purchased memberships for friends wrote, â€œIâ€™ve been a silent contributor to the group out of fear of similar action. Iâ€™ve not been terminated but Iâ€™ve been pissed about them removing features under the guise of â€˜we can change the memberships as theyâ€™re not guaranteed.â€™â€�â€œThe second they see members saying bad things they cancel your membership and don't give you your money back.â€�Others said they were waiting until their membership expired to voice an honest opinion. â€œUnfortunately I can't go on the record because it seems like, the second they see members saying bad things they cancel your membership and don't give you your money back,â€� wrote one current member in a text to The Verge. â€œBut the second my membership is over I plan on writing a scathing review so people don't have to get conned by these people.â€�JetSmarterâ€™s aggressive image maintenance seems to be working, at least according to the members who expressed fear about voicing complaints. But the non-disparagement clause may be unenforceable. Late last year, the US passed the Consumer Review Fairness Act, which prohibits companies from writing gag clauses into contracts or terms of service that prohibit negative reviews. The act, says Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, â€œwas clearly meant to pick up quote-unquote â€˜non disparagementâ€™ clauses.â€� The law, parts of which went into effect this month, would seem to cover JetSmarterâ€™s non-disparagement terms. â€œThat clause [in JetSmarterâ€™s member agreement] almost certainly runs afoul of the Consumer Review Fairness Act,â€� he says. The FTC and state attorneys general will be vested with enforcement power under the act, although itâ€™s yet to be seen how often they bring legal action.JetSmarter told The Verge that any member who says they were thrown out for speaking ill of the company isn't telling the truth and they were rejected for valid reasons, though the company declined to provide details. But Petrossov was blunt about policing the JetSmarter community and removing anyone who caused issues with other customers. â€œIâ€™ll be frank with you, there are certain people who donâ€™t mesh with our community. And we take a very strict stance toward the type of people we bring in,â€� said Petrossov. â€œYouâ€™re in a tube, youâ€™re in a small airplane and we are trying to create a group of people that are like-minded, that are respectful to each other. Itâ€™s very difficult. This has not been an easy thing to do.â€�    ""You know you are in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams."" - Dr. Sueuss |  : @c_karakus A post shared by JetSmarter (@jetsmarter) on Feb 14, 2017 at 7:55am PST JetSmarter is trying to pull off a delicate balancing act. It offers its members privacy, while offering up the prospect of mingling with the wealthy and famous as an enticement to new members. The companyâ€™s executives talk constantly about bringing the benefits of private air travel to a new class of people. â€œIt would not be an understatement to say we have changed many peopleâ€™s lives,â€� says Torossian. But when members complain, the response from the company has been to blame the entitlement of the rich. â€œWhat youâ€™re talking about is somebody wonâ€™t pay a few hundreds dollars to take a helicopter, to get on a private plane?â€� asked Torossian. â€œIt sounds to me like very wealthy people, most of whom are very happy with the company, who might feel like the company should be subsidizing everything they do.â€�Petrossov agreed. â€œItâ€™s kind of trivial, you have wealthy people complaining about private jets. Itâ€™s a bit crazy in the whole scheme of things. It is painful to us when certain members really think they are not getting enough value.â€� He argued every tweak to the service had only improved the offering. â€œWeâ€™ve given people 10,000 times more than what they were buying into back then.â€� Still, he conceded, JetSmarter had a role to play as well. â€œAt the end of the day a lot of this is about managing expectations.â€� â€œItâ€™s kind of trivial, you have wealthy people complaining about private jets.â€�A current member agreed with that assessment: â€œWhat they are projecting, itâ€™s luxury, itâ€™s like nothing youâ€™ve experienced before, private jet travel but much cheaper. Anyone who has some common sense realizes itâ€™s not really all those things.â€� The problem, he felt, was that members were promised the moon before they signed up. â€œNothing will ever cost you anything, we wonâ€™t nickel and dime you, luxury white glove service.â€� The value of the flights was good, but he felt the actual experience was a letdown. â€œWith great expectations come great disappointments.â€�  For now, this member was on the fence about renewing. It used to be easy to get a flight on a weekâ€™s notice. Now, â€œI have to book a month out, which isnâ€™t great with my travel patterns. So the value kind of diminishes.â€� He felt JetSmarter had transformed from a romantic adventure to an unpredictable headache. â€œThey are going through the same thing the airlines went through, except in two years instead of 40.â€�Additional reporting by Nikki Erlick and Stephan Kozub",2017.0,3.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

",2017-03-15,"      Genius quietly laid off a bunch of its engineers â€” now can it survive as a media company? Genius, which raised $56.9 million on the promise that it would one day annotate the entire internet, has been losing its minds. In January, the company quietly laid off a quarter of its staff, with the bulk of the cuts coming from the engineering department. In a post on the Genius blog at the time, co-founder Tom Lehman told employees that Genius planned to shift its emphasis away from the annotation platform that once attracted top-tier investors in favor of becoming a more video-focused media company. â€œAfter taking a careful look at the company and our priorities,â€� Lehman wrote, â€œweâ€™ve had to make some tough decisions about how we want to spend our resources. And unfortunately this meant that today we laid off some very talented people.â€� The company then took the unusual step of posting the Genius usernames of those it had laid off â€” 12 full-time and five part-time employees. â€œWe needed to shift resources from capturing knowledge... toward packaging and distributing knowledge.â€�At the same time, Lehman noted that the company was continuing to hire for roles in video and sales. The company recently redesigned its homepage with expanded space for editorial content and advertising. It has also been deepening its Behind the Lyrics partnership with Spotify, for which it contributes a mix of song lyrics and factoids that pop up in a slideshow format when youâ€™re listening to popular songs.â€œThe change we made in January was in recognition of the fact that we needed to shift resources from capturing knowledge â€” which we've been doing almost exclusively for the past five years â€” toward packaging and distributing knowledge into easy-to-consume formats like video and Spotify Behind the Lyrics,â€� Lehman told The Verge. Itâ€™s not unusual for tech companies to transform over time, though typically they are loath to lay off engineers. But Geniusâ€™ shift is more dramatic than most: going from all-encompassing annotator of the internet to a more traditional media company model, chasing video views alongside an ever-growing number of well-capitalized competitors. The move illustrates the companyâ€™s difficulty attracting contributors â€” and an audience for their contributions â€” particularly outside of the music world.In an interview last week, Lehman said the company had turned to video in an effort to reach its core audienceâ€š which continues to be rap fans, beyond its website and mobile apps. â€œVideo makes it a little bit more accessible,â€� he said. â€œI love the Genius website. One of my favorite websites. But it can be a little frustrating to use. You have to be really, really dedicated to learn everything about a song on Genius. Youâ€™ve got to be down to click and read a lot.â€�Geniusâ€™ videos to date have included interviews with artists about their craft, and a series where rappers perform original freestyle verses. One of Lehmanâ€™s favorite videos traces a whistle sample featured in a series of popular songs back to its origins in a Quentin Tarantino movie. Last week, Genius posted a video about rapper Lil Yachty learning how to make pizza. The company is also investing in original editorial content, aggregating news headlines, doing Q&ampampAs with artists like the Track Burnaz, and writing short profiles.â€œI love the Genius website. One of my favorite websites. But it can be a little frustrating to use.â€�Lehman said the new focus is in keeping with Geniusâ€™ original mission of helping people look deeper into popular culture. Videos often contain information that came from user-contributed annotations, Lehman said, and the format is more popular than the plain-text notes on which Genius was founded. ""All of the knowledge in our videos is rooted in what the community is doing,"" he said.The shift is the latest chapter in a company that has spent several years setting outsized expectations. Founded in October 2009, Genius joined the prestigious accelerator Y Combinator in 2011. The accelerator had previously been responsible for growing Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe, and Genius arrived with large ambitions of its own. Traffic to the website grew quickly in 2011, and it became the default destination for anyone seeking song lyrics or their significance. The next year, Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz put $15 million into the company, recognizing a more ambitious opportunity. â€œIt turns out that Rap Genius has a much bigger idea and a much broader mission than [rap],â€� the firm's co-founder, Marc Andreessen, wrote at the time. ""Which is: Generalize out to many other categories of text... annotate the world... be the knowledge about the knowledge... create the Internet Talmud.""For Andreessen, the mission was personal. Before starting his venture capital firm with Ben Horowitz, Andreessen had co-invented Mosaic, the first web browser. As he explained in a post on Genius, â€œIt seemed obvious to us that users would want to annotate all text on the web â€“ our idea was that each web page would be a launchpad for insight and debate about its own contents.â€� But the infrastructure of the web could not yet support such a system, and Mosaic gave up on the effort.Genius, then, represented a chance to make good on one of the earliest promises of the web. And as Genius grew, so did its offerings: News Genius, Poetry Genius, and Rock Genius all followed.As it developed, the company suffered growing pains. It went years without licensing the lyrics it hosted, capitulating only after receiving a takedown notice from the National Music Publishers Association. It later admitted to using unscrupulous search engine optimization tactics, leading Google to temporarily demote it in search rankings. The founders developed a reputation for cocky posturing â€” all three wore sunglasses onstage during their talk at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013 and continued to describe the site in the loftiest of terms. â€œRap Genius is going be the fabric of the internet,â€� co-founder Mahbod Moghadam said in 2014â€œRap Genius is going be the fabric of the internet,â€� co-founder Mahbod Moghadam said in 2014. â€œWeâ€™re going to have annotations on other sites, so every other site in the world like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times are going be Genius-powered and theyâ€™re going to have our annotations on them. And then the Genius platform will take over the internet everyoneâ€™s most important statistic that they have in life is their Genius IQ.â€�Moghadam resigned two months later for annotations he made on the manifesto of Elliot Rodger, who shot and killed six people and injured 14 others in Isla Vista, California. Soon after, Genius made a definitive push to realize Andreessenâ€™s vision. By 2015, Genius claimed 40 million visitors to its website a month, 1 million of whom had annotated a post. Eminem, producer Rick Rubin, and the novelist Junot Diaz were among those who had contributed annotations. In January of that year, the company began testing a tool called the web annotator, which allowed anyone to add genius.it/ before any URL and then highlight and annotate text.The web annotator was the centerpiece of the companyâ€™s efforts to become a kind of universal comments section for the internet. But it faced a storm of criticism last year after some writers complained the tool was being used to harass them. The annotator also raised concerns that it could have been used to inject malicious code onto visitorsâ€™ computers, though itâ€™s since been tweaked to address that vulnerability.But the biggest problem with the annotator from Geniusâ€™ perspective is that few individuals are using it. After more than two years of development, the Chrome extension has only 12,320 users. It was last updated in June 2016.After more than two years of development, the Chrome extension has only 12,320 usersA separate effort to encourage people to annotate political speeches and other current events content at News Genius faced hurdles of its own. An editor hired to evangelize for the platform left after seven months, and was not replaced. Promised partnerships with major news media organizations never materialized, except in the case of The Washington Postâ€™s Fix blog, which still occasionally uses the platform to annotate the news. One former employee said the company had never put enough resources into the project. â€œNews Genius always seemed really remedial,â€� the employee said.About 600,000 people visit News Genius a month, Lehman said, a figure that had grown 10 times since before President Donald Trump was inaugurated. And the number of people who annotate a post on Genius each month is now at 10,000, up 30 percent from the start of the year. â€œMore people are using News Genius now than ever,â€� Lehman said. Meanwhile, overall traffic to the website and apps has grown to 62 million a month.Lehman says the LA Times, The Boston Globe, and Univision are News Genius users. But the organizations appear to have used the tool only sporadically over the past year â€” and rarely since the election, when calls for more context around the daily news began to intensify. The company has been largely absent from the debate around fake news, even though News Genius was intended to push back against dubious claims. One of the Timesâ€™ political reporters has used the tool just two times. â€œIt depends on how you define â€˜active,â€™ but we do continue to use Genius,â€� a Times spokeswoman said, noting that reporters use the tool to mark up major political speeches. The company has been largely absent from the debate around fake news, even though News Genius was intended to push back against dubious claimsThe company partnered with GQ in October to annotate the magazineâ€™s interview with Kendrick Lamar. â€œThis was a rare win for the web annotator,â€� one former employee said. Meanwhile, few new publishers appear to be signing up to use the tool, giving Genius fewer big channels with which to promote its use for current events. And other news organizations are building similar features of their own. NPR has created an annotator that places notes in the body of the text â€” and the LA Times has considered using that tool as well, a spokeswoman said. The nonprofit organization OpenNews has built an open-source tool of its own for newsrooms to use.Toward the end of 2016, at least some employees began to wonder whether Genius was breaking through to the mainstream. Neither Andreessen nor his co-founder Ben Horowitz, has contributed an annotation since 2015. (A spokeswoman said Horowitz, who sits on the Genius board, was not available for comment.) According to company legend, the rapper ASAP Rocky once threw up in their offices â€” but maybe now Genius has lost some of its cultural edge. â€œNo one seemed to interact with Genius independently of me throwing a link at them and saying, â€˜click on this,â€™â€� one former employee said. â€œIt seemed like a lot of the user base was white kids in Australia.â€�The company also seems to be restructuring its revenue model. Though the Genius has had a chief revenue officer and a vice president of partnerships, it only recently announced its first jobs in sales. â€œIt's unclear what the sales process was [or] is,â€� one former employee said. â€œBasically, it's a skeletal staff, whose ad revenue appears to not be able to keep up with company expenses.â€�Asked whether the company would continue trying to build a massive tech platform, Lehman said Geniusâ€™ vision remains as large as ever â€” but that itâ€™s narrowing the scope of its editorial ambitions, and leaning on tried-and-true media formats to reach its audience. Genius has hired seven people since the layoffs, Lehman said, mostly in video. â€œWe have so many near-term opportunities with music that we donâ€™t want to let them slip through our fingers,â€� he said.And as for the ASAP Rocky vomiting episode? Lehman declined to address that matter directly, although he did seem to acknowledge the possibility. â€œIt is,â€� he said, â€œa great office to throw up in.â€�Correction, 12:42 p.m.: This post has been updated to reflect that the number of people laid off at Genius represented a quarter of the staff, not a third.",2017.0,3.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

",2017-01-12,"      Demand for secret messaging apps is rising as Trump takes office Two weeks after the US presidential election, Reverend Rebecca Bryan stepped up to her pulpit in the Boston suburb of Brookline and looked out on her congregation. The liberal Unitarian Universalists at First Parish were already gearing up for political action, a central tenet of the churchâ€™s 300-year-old mission. The members regularly protest for immigration and prison reform. Post-election, they were debating turning the church into a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants. That Sunday, Bryan shared an idea about how to communicate: â€œWhats-App,â€� she said, enunciating the two syllables as if trying the name out for the first time. â€œA group that is entirely encrypted, where we know what we share is completely safe.â€� Nathan Freitas, a software developer and privacy activist, was sitting in the pews. â€œIâ€™m like, did my reverend just use the word â€˜encryptionâ€™?â€� â€œDid my reverend just use the word â€˜encryptionâ€™?â€�Freitas had mentioned WhatsApp to Reverend Bryan as a tool for the parishâ€™s social action because last year, the worldâ€™s most popular messaging app updated to using end-to-end encryption by default. That means messages donâ€™t live on servers and arenâ€™t readable to eavesdroppers, or even WhatsAppâ€™s parent company, Facebook. Overnight, the words typed by a billion people were whisked from the threat of surveillance, thanks to the code developed by a San Francisco open-source project called Open Whisper Systems.   Founded in 2013 by idealistic cryptographer Moxie Marlinspike, Open Whisper developed the protocol adopted by not only WhatsApp, but Facebook Messengerâ€™s â€œsecret conversationsâ€� feature, and Google Alloâ€™s â€œincognito mode.â€� Open Whisper also has its own flagship messaging app called Signal, and people have been flocking to it since the election. On November 9th Signal vaulted up App Annieâ€™s ranking of the most popular iOS social networking apps, from 98th place to 45th. Worldwide downloads grew 70 percent in the last quarter of 2016, with nearly half a million downloads coming from the US. As activists and wary citizens prepare for a president-elect who seemingly disdains the First Amendment, flirts with the idea of creating a Muslim registry, and will soon sit atop a powerful surveillance apparatus, Signal has become the gateway drug to the encrypted life.While Trumpâ€™s election helped propel Signal toward the mainstream, the Trump era heralds more uncertainty for encryptionâ€™s already uncertain future. On one hand, law-and-order Trump has made statements about protecting the country from hacks, announcing in early January that heâ€™d start a committee in his first 90 days in office to combat cyberattacks (â€œWeâ€™re like the hacking capital of the world,â€� he told reporters). Yet heâ€™s also spoken critically about encryption and privacy protections. On the campaign trail, Trump blasted Apple for refusing to break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters and spoke enviously about Russiaâ€™s hacking of the Democratic National Committee â€” â€œI wish I had that power,â€� he said at a press conference, â€œman, that would be power.â€� Trump has already appointed encryption critic Jeff Sessions as head of the justice department, and â€œrobust surveillanceâ€� advocate Mike Pompeo to head the CIA.In the meantime, Signalâ€™s post-election popularity appears to be more than a temporary blip. Marlinspike said the app is getting more sustained daily downloads than Open Whisperâ€™s encrypted products did after its second biggest boost: Edward Snowdenâ€™s revelations about the surveillance conducted by the NSA. It was five weeks since the election when I met Moxie Marlinspike at the humble office he shares in San Franciscoâ€™s Mission District. Open Whisperâ€™s logo is printed on a sheet of paper and taped to the door, which Marlinspike opened as he showed me into the kitchen. An aerobics class pounded through the ceiling. His blond dreads were gathered into a ponytail, and he wore a black hoodie zipped over another black hoodie â€” the cliche hacker getup, squared. â€œI donâ€™t have a lot of clothes,â€� he explained.While he now lives in an Oakland apartment, Marlinspike used to have a more itinerant lifestyle he lived in a warehouse after moving to San Francisco in the late â€˜90s as a college-shirking coding wunderkind. He took breaks from software jobs to indulge his wanderlust, sailing around the Bahamas and jumping trains across the US. In 2015, he posted a picture on his Instagram standing next to Signalâ€™s most famous endorser, Edward Snowden, in Moscow. But all those biographical facts come from the internet: Marlinspike is cagey on all personal details, reticent to reveal anything beyond the fact that heâ€™s now housed. Heâ€™s equally tight-lipped on the election, not revealing whether heâ€™d even voted. Marlinspike is a reluctant participant in Silicon Valleyâ€™s startup culture. â€œWhen I was a kid, â€˜entrepreneurâ€™ was not a compliment,â€� he said. â€œThat wasnâ€™t the kind of thing college kids sat around in their dorm rooms dreaming about.â€� Marlinspike worked for other software companies for years, and his first startup, Whisper Systems, was put on hold when he was acquihired by Twitter in 2011 to head its security department. The gig didn't last long. Fourteen months later, Marlinspike walked away from $1 million in stock options, quitting after a near-death sailing incident in San Francisco Bay to get back to the work that most fascinated him. He returned to developing two encrypted apps for Android: TextSecure for messaging, and RedPhone for calls. In 2015, he folded both services into Signal. Signalâ€™s clean blue-and-white design makes it nearly indistinguishable from any other messenger. Apart from a few missing features like sending voice messages on iOS (development is in progress), thereâ€™s little it canâ€™t do. Signal is widely regarded as the best in field for security, both for its encryption and for retaining less info on its users than other privacy-focused apps. People also tout its ease, devoid of the clunky shenanigans of PGP encryption. The only hint of its underlying security is when using Signal for phone calls. Once both parties are connected, each is given a random pairing of words to confirm the identity of the person on the other end of the line.  If encryption is difficult it self-selects for people willing to jump through those hoops, and bad guys are always willing to jump through the hoopsThree years in, Open Whisper is still running with a skeleton crew: just five employees, plus more than a dozen contributors in the open-source community. Marlinspike wants to grow that team, and heâ€™s hunting for talent willing to sacrifice the usual tech salaries and cush Silicon Valley perks. (The website states that thereâ€™s â€œno gym membership, but any time you feel like doing push-ups, we'll do them with you.â€�) Open Whisper doesnâ€™t patent its open-source protocol, giving it away to the most highly valued companies on the planet for free. Instead, Open Whispersâ€™ work is completely funded by private donors and foundation grants. (Marlinspike declined to name individual donors, and tax forms donâ€™t disclose them.)Marlinspikeâ€™s goal isnâ€™t unicorn riches, but unicorn ubiquity. For that, he wants to make encrypted messaging as easy â€” as beautiful, as fun, as expressive, as emoji-laden â€” as your default messaging app. His reason: if encryption is difficult, it self-selects for people willing to jump through those hoops. And bad guys are always willing to jump through the hoops. â€œISIS or high-risk criminal activity will be willing to click two extra times,â€� he told me. â€œYou and I are not.â€� â€œWhat?!â€� I ask. â€œYou are, arenâ€™t you?â€�â€œAt this point â€” no,â€� he said. â€œIâ€™m unwilling. I donâ€™t use PGP. I donâ€™t do any wing nut stuff. I just want to be a normal person. Unless you have Facebook and Gmail, you wonâ€™t understand what peopleâ€™s expectations are.â€� Marlinspike thinks the reign of the crypto-nerds has lasted long enough: â€œThere are some people whoâ€™ve built an identity around learning how to use this crazy stuff. And if the basis of your identity is you have master skills that are difficult to use, youâ€™re not incentivized to help other people to do it.â€� Marlinspike wants to make encryption uncoolly mainstream, in the way Facebook became uncool when everyone's parents got an account. Thatâ€™s because Marlinspike said people will find that the classic dismissal of encryption â€” â€œI have nothing to hideâ€�  â€” isnâ€™t actually true if the government or nefarious hackers target them. Who doesnâ€™t have an email sitting in their inbox that would embarrass them to death should it be revealed? And Marlinspike wrote that with 27,000 pages of federal statutes and 10,000 administrative regulations, â€œYou probably do have something to hide, you just donâ€™t know it yet.â€� With complete computer security now impossible, he said, the only way to ensure privacy is to make the hacked spoils useless â€” like a thief getting into a lockbox to find only lumps of coal. â€œIf you have an unencrypted email sitting somewhere, it will become public,â€� he states plainly with no hint of alarm. â€œThat is the inevitable outcome.â€� Thereâ€™s no question Washington learned the value of better encryption during the presidential election, with the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman John Podesta. After the DNC learned it had been compromised, Clintonâ€™s campaign staffers were instructed to use Signal for any communications regarding Trump. It was, Marlinspike said, a â€œgood decision.â€�                  Cam Floyd  Though digital security buffs have long preached about Tor and Signal at professional conferences, for many surveillance can seem like a distant threat, one that is logistically annoying and just a little tinfoil hatty to deal with. Certainly, some communities have been vigilant about the safety of their communications. Snowden and Laura Poitras were early Signal adopters and hearty endorsers. Civil rights activists also used the app early on, having dealt with government spying since at least COINTELPRO, continuing on to the FBIâ€™s surveillance flights above Black Lives Matter protests. â€œFirst of all, black communities been knowing that we had to code our communications,â€� said Malkia Cyril of the Oakland-based Center for Media Justice, who has used Signal to organize Black Lives Matter actions with other activists since 2014. â€œWe been coding our communications since slavery. The knowledge of the need is not whatâ€™s missing for us. Itâ€™s the skills and the information.â€� But for the ranks of the lazy, oblivious, or those privileged enough to assume they wouldnâ€™t be targeted, there was always an excuse to put off switching to encrypted communication. â€œI'm not doing anything wrong so what do I care about the NSA,â€� as one documentary filmmaker put it to me recently, or, as summed up in a recent Google chat with a friend, â€œI've debated that... but it seems like so much work!â€�Trumpâ€™s election has prompted many to reconsider their relationship to surveillance. The week after the election, Deanna Zandt, a Brooklyn-based digital strategist with hot-pink-and-purple hair, sent out an email to her clients advocating Signal. â€œHey y'all, As the future looms so pale in front of us, a lot of us tech folks are gearing up for the long haul. I wanted to make sure that everyone feels like they have a handle on how to keep themselves secure online,â€� she wrote. For the ranks of the lazy, oblivious, or those privileged enough to assume they wouldnâ€™t be targeted, there was always an excuseZandt advises nonprofits like Race Forward, Women Action &ampamp the Media, and Planned Parenthood, organizations that are not just worried about government surveillance, but doxxing from political opponents. â€œThereâ€™s a reason people volunteer to be clinic escorts in the offline world,â€� Zandt said. â€œWe need the equivalent of that level of security in the online world as well.â€� That doesnâ€™t mean everyone is psyched about the logistics of it â€” when Zandt stood before a Race Forward staff meeting in New York recently and instructed them to swap out their legions of saved passwords for more complicated ones, she was met with groans. â€œWhen we talked about the revelations of Snowden, it was hard to convince some folks on the progressive side to care,â€� said Josh Levy, advocacy director of Access Now, a nonprofit that runs a digital security hotline to counsel activists around the world on how to avoid surveillance. â€œI would talk to folks about the vulnerability of their data and reliance on large commercial platforms, but because of their trust in the presidentâ€� â€” meaning Obama â€” â€œthey didnâ€™t pay attention to it. Iâ€™d say, â€˜What if Trump came to have access to that data?â€™â€�  Americans had been a minority of callers to Access Nowâ€™s digital security hotline. In the weeks post-election, Americans dominated it.The nascent Trump opposition has also been organizing a slew of digital privacy crash courses. The human rights organization Security First said theyâ€™ve gotten 20 post-election requests from US media and community groups for digital security consulting, double the amount they normally get over an entire year. Cyrilâ€™s Center for Media Justice co-hosted a forum to discuss police surveillance in Washington, DC, and the Freedom of the Press Foundation â€” the fiscal sponsor of Open Whisper Systems â€” spoke at a standing room-only Brooklyn cryptoparty in early December called â€œCommunicating in Trumpâ€™s America.â€� That event was a coming out of sorts for the newly crypto-woke, people like Phyllis, a 29-year-old GIF artist in Brooklyn, whose website portrait features her lying on candy in a gummy worm sweatshirt. Phyllis considers herself an â€œamateur activist.â€� She had always been interested in online privacy given that her laptop is her primary work tool, but (common story) had never actually gotten around to doing much about it. Jarred by Trumpâ€™s election, sheâ€™s helping organize a group of graphic designers to do pro bono work for civil rights causes. She came away from the cryptoparty with an action item for the graphic designersâ€™ first meeting: everyone join a Signal group chat. â€œFriends doing activism stuff are more proactive about it,â€� Phyllis said. â€œMy friends [who are] not as involved donâ€™t see the need to do it. I texted a friend like are you meeting me at a certain time? And no response. So I gave up on logistical non-activism stuff.â€� Some users say theyâ€™re constantly arbitraging texts â€” political info to Signal, banalities to other messengers. â€œIf youâ€™re talking about the Emmys, please get up off my Signal,â€� said Cyril of the Center for Media Justice. â€œI donâ€™t need to encrypt a conversation with my wife about what groceries we need to buy.â€� But JP, a Bay Area documentary filmmaker, got his family on the app, and theyâ€™re already using it for not-so-sensitive intel (to wit: â€œWe are gonna study at Brianna's house but going to Trader Joe's real quick for snacks.â€�) Marlinspike said now is the perfect time for Signal to teeter on default status in politically active circles. People donâ€™t generally interrupt a protest to ask, â€œâ€˜Wait a second, what app should we be using?â€™â€�he said. â€œThatâ€™s why making this stuff the new normal and a successful part of everyday life is important.â€� So for Marlinspike, an arguably bigger moment for encryption than the election came when WhatsApp or the â€œsecret conversationsâ€� feature of Facebook Messenger adopted his protocol, inching him closer to his goal: that Signal-style encryption becomes so universal that he works himself out of his job, Mary Poppins-style. â€œIf youâ€™re talking about the Emmys, please get up off my Signal.â€�While the makers of encrypted services say theyâ€™ve seen previous spikes in activity around current events, Trumpâ€™s rise seems different. Nathan Freitas, the Unitarian Universalist developer, directs an open-source organization called the Guardian Project, which created the Tor browser for Android named Orbot. When a Brazilian judge outlawed WhatsApp for a few days in May, downloads of Orbot shot up 24 percent in the first 24 hours. Another spike came after the Turkish prime minister briefly blocked Twitter during 2014 protests. Freitas said daily Orbot downloads in the United States are up 30 percent after the election, and holding steady. Heâ€™s also been fielding demands for more secure options on iOS â€” including an updated Tor browser and a way to route apps through Tor. And Freitas has witnessed other post-election changes: his 10-year collection of activists in his phone contacts have begun pinging him on Signal.â€œWeâ€™ll see a time-bound spike for a day or a week and then things go back to normal. Whatâ€™s different in this case,â€� Freitas said of Trumpâ€™s election, â€œis things donâ€™t go back to normal.â€� Like Signal, the Guardian Project is partially funded by the Open Technology Fund, a federally funded program that, since 2012, channels money to technologies that promote transparent societies, circumvent censorship, or skirt surveillance around the globe. ""We just never anticipated it was going to become a domestic issue, because we were thinking about tyrannies,"" a source close to the OTF said. Marlinspike said â€œit would be a shameâ€� if the new administration interfered in future OTF funding for encryption. The money for the fund is earmarked by Congress, so itâ€™s subject to political tinkering and has fluctuated over its five-year life. Still, support for internet freedom appears in appropriations bills since 2012, fanned out over several departments. ""Why would we [the US] stop supporting something that upsets Russia, Iran, and North Korea?â€� the source close to OTF said. â€œIf those people hate this work, I would continue to do it.""                Cam Floyd  Itâ€™s unclear how the new administrationâ€™s actions could affect the new crypto-awakening. Increasingly aggressive surveillance policies could solidify the interest, prompting more people to make Signal their default messaging app. But there are several ways the administration could make things difficult for the project, and though Trump hasnâ€™t yet said Signal by name, all signs point to him not liking the concept one bit. Trump badgered Apple earlier this year for refusing to decrypt one of the San Bernardino shooterâ€™s iPhones at the request of the FBI: â€œWho do they think they are?â€� he sneered in an interview on Fox &ampamp Friends. Meanwhile, Marlinspike literally led a round of applause to praise Appleâ€™s position onstage at a San Francisco cryptography conference, stating, â€œI actually think that law enforcement should be difficult. And, in fact, I think it actually should be possible to break the law.â€� â€œI donâ€™t like ISIS. Fuck those people, right? Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m happy that theyâ€™re using Signal.â€� Back at his Mission District headquarters, Marlinspike clarified his statement. He said heâ€™s not agnostic about how people are using Signal. â€œI have opinions. I donâ€™t like ISIS. Fuck those people, right? Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m happy that theyâ€™re using Signal or something like that.â€� But, he said, bad actors will always find a way to encrypt their communications, while the average person will only do so if itâ€™s easy. Yet that criminal activity â€” or at least the suspicion thereof â€” will always provide the major argument against encryption. Signal was legally challenged for the first time last year, when a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, subpoenaed all Signal data, messages, and subscriber details associated with two phone numbers for an unspecified criminal investigation. One turned out not to be a Signal user. For the other, Signal disclosed the only info it logs: when the phone number first downloaded the app, and the last time they used the service. Signal also lawyered up with ACLU attorneys and challenged the grand juryâ€™s gag order forbidding them from publicizing the subpoena. Signal won, and wrote a blog post about the ordeal. The new administration will have a range of policy carrots and sticks at its disposal. â€œUltimately, itâ€™s not going to be possible to stop encryption from being used by people,â€� said Electronic Frontier Foundation executive director Cindy Cohn, â€œbecause encryption is applied math, and it turns out you canâ€™t ban math. But the government can do a lot to discourage use of the tools.â€� For instance, Cohn said, lawmakers could require a backdoor to messages for law enforcement, or the FBI could pressure companies into weakening security. Companies are â€œsusceptible because maybe they want to be a government contractor, or cooperate with investors or business partners that insinuate that they cooperate with law enforcement,â€� Cohn said. â€œI donâ€™t have a clear map of all the pressure points, but itâ€™s not hard to think about the various ways this could happen.â€�In December, a House working group released a report advocating a middle ground approach to any future regulations, arguing encryption was necessary for national defense and to safeguard critical infrastructure, yet creates trouble for law enforcement that â€œcannot be ignored.â€�As our interview wrapped up, Marlinspike hopped into the elevator to head out into the dark-too-early December afternoon at the corner of 16th and Mission. The street has hosted its share of both World Series victory riots and political marches. Iâ€™d read that Marlinspike used to attend political protests, and when I asked if he attended an anti-Trump one, he just answered, â€œI donâ€™t really want to talk about that,â€� and smiled. He questions why reporters label him an anarchist. Well, is that a misnomer? He paused for awhile, then replied, â€œItâ€™s complicated.â€� That falls into his personal beliefs, a topic he doesnâ€™t want to talk much about. â€œIâ€™m not at all used to being a public figure, you know what I mean? Iâ€™m a private person.â€�â€œIâ€™m less interested in asking people to stop surveilling us, than doing things so that they canâ€™t surveil us.â€�Marlinspike prefers to let his tech speak for itself: a tool with clear political implications and anti-authoritarian uses. Thatâ€™s where heâ€™s more useful anyways, he said: pushing code, not policy. â€œIâ€™m happy to support people fighting that fight [for encryption], but simply people like Apple computer or Facebook are probably better positioned to have those conversations than I am.â€� Marlinspike instead will force the issue by continuing to roll out his protocol. He likens Signal to the demonstrators at Standing Rock, who stopped the oil pipeline by physically blocking its construction. â€œIâ€™m less interested in asking people to stop surveilling us, than doing things so that they canâ€™t surveil us,â€� Marlinspike said. â€œThat direct action is what I want to continue to focus on.â€� Lately heâ€™s gotten some experience sparring with governments trying to ban his work. When Signal was blocked in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in December, Open Whisper fought back successfully with a workaround for its Android app. Reading the news, I texted him on Signal about whether heâ€™d do the same if ever blocked in the United States.His reply pings:  â€œYeah weâ€™d work to make it available.â€� ",2017.0,1.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

",2016-12-07,"      To get to the Panoptic Studio at Carnegie Mellon University, you take an elevator down four flights to a dingy sub-basement. Inside room B510, a series of metal cross beams enclose a massive, otherworldly structure: a geodesic dome. Each of the wooden domeâ€™s hexagonal panels is covered with a tangle of wires, cameras, and connectors, and a steady thrum emanates from the rows of computers that surround the hulking structure. At the bottom of the dome, a single panel is missing and bright light streams out, making it difficult to see whatâ€™s inside. It looks like a portal to another dimension. â€œPeople, when they come in here, they often ask us what this thing is,â€� says Tomas Simon, research assistant in the lab, with a joking grin. â€œWe tell them a time machine, and usually they believe us.â€�  Step inside the portal and everything is white, calm, silent: this is where researchers are helping craft the future of virtual reality. I speak out loud, and my voice echoes around the empty space. In place of the clutter on the outside, each panel is unadorned, save for a series of small black spots: cameras recording your every move. There are 480 VGA cameras and 30 HD cameras, as well as 10 RGB-D depth sensors borrowed from Xbox gaming consoles. The massive collection of recording apparatus is synced together, and its collective output is combined into a single, digital file. One minute of recording amounts to 600GB of data.The hundreds of cameras record people talking, bartering, and playing games. Imagine the motion-capture systems used by Hollywood filmmakers, but on steroids. The footage it records captures a stunningly accurate three-dimensional representation of peopleâ€™s bodies in motion, from the bend in an elbow to a wrinkle in your brow. The lab is trying to map the language of our bodies, the signals and social cues we send one another with our hands, posture, and gaze. It is building a database that aims to decipher the constant, unspoken communication we all use without thinking, what the early 20th century anthropologist Edward Sapir once called an ""elaborate code that is written nowhere, known to no one, and understood by all.""The original goal of the Panoptic Studio was to use this understanding of body language to improve the way robots relate to human beings, to make them more natural partners at work or in play. But the research being done here has recently found another purpose. What works for making robots more lifelike and social could also be applied to virtual characters. Thatâ€™s why this basement lab caught the attention of one of the biggest players in virtual reality: Facebook. In April 2015, the Silicon Valley giant hired Yaser Sheikh, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon and director of the Panoptic Studio, to assist in research to improve social interaction in VR.""There is nothing people are more keenly aware of than other people.""For Facebook, virtual reality represents the next great computing platform and the ultimate evolution of Zuckerbergâ€™s social network. Our communication has evolved from text to photos to video to live video and virtual reality is the obvious next step. ""We all know where we want to improve and where we want virtual reality to eventually get,"" said Zuckerberg during his keynote at the recent Oculus Connect. ""Itâ€™s this feeling of real presence, like youâ€™re really there with another person."" This week Oculus, which is owned by Facebook,&ampnbspreleased Touch Controllers for its Rift VR system, allowing users to integrate more of their body into virtual space. But the technology has a long way to go.""Making social interactions in VR as natural as the ones weâ€™re used to in the real world is one of the grand technological challenges today,"" said Sheikh, speaking at this yearâ€™s F8 conference. ""Itâ€™s a challenge because there is nothing people are more keenly aware of than other people. So the bar for deeply convincing virtual interactions is extremely high. But for the same reason, once that bar is reached, lifelike virtual interactions will be a transformative achievement, vastly extending our personal world, and connecting the world together in a way we havenâ€™t seen before.""             The Panoptic Studio During my trip to the Panoptic Studio, Simon and another research assistant took me through one of the exercises the team uses to collect data. Standing inside the geodesic dome, we played a game called Ultimatum, in which three participants haggle over how to split 10 dollars. For anyone to receive money, all three have to agree on how itâ€™s shared. Itâ€™s a classic experiment in economics and game theory, with participants trying to weigh how much they can squeeze out for themselves without losing everything by failing to reach a consensus.Roughly two-thirds of what we communicate with one another comes through nonverbal cuesItâ€™s also a great opportunity to study body language. The three of us stood face to face, two aligned against one. As we bargained back and forth for several minutes, we were constantly shifting our postures, gaze, and position from one another. During the negotiations I tried to project confidence, but the results spoke for themselves: I ended up taking home two dollars, while my hosts pocketed four bucks each.After the game, we left the dome and headed to a bank of computers to review the footage. I could watch a replay of our conversation from 500 different angles, and they all told the same story. I began with an aggressive pose, my hands splayed in front, body squared, eyes fixed on the duo I was bargaining with. But as the game progressed I began fidgeting, rubbing my wrists, stepping backwards, and looking down at my shoes.Your body often expresses inconvenient truths that your words are meant to mask, said Simon. ""If what Iâ€™m saying doesnâ€™t agree with the way Iâ€™m saying it, or what Iâ€™m doing, people will almost always listen to your body motion, or your non-verbal behavior, rather than your words."" Decades of academic research have confirmed this primacy of body language, with scholars estimating that roughly two-thirds of what we communicate with one another comes through nonverbal cues.             Skeletal tracking captured by the Panoptic Studio Body language is a deeply instinctual: children as young as one or two years old can understand social cues from facial expressions and posture. And scientific experiments have demonstrated that individuals who are blind from birth will gesture when they talk, even though they have never learned to gesture from watching others.Our minds are so primed to pick up on body language that we can recognize signals even when shown only the most basic outline of the human form. A number of academic studies have shown that people can distinguish biological motion from mechanical motions with just 20 points on a screen. ""Our brains are remarkable inference engines, able to draw upon millennia of evolution and a lifetime of experience to transform these sparse points into fleshed out people in our imagination, and to predict the next actions of those imagined people as well,"" said Sheikh during Facebookâ€™s F8 conference. ""The challenge of making the pipeline of social VR work is to learn how to computationally do the same sort of inference and prediction.""Something as simple as a stare can convey anger, lust, or confusionArtificial intelligence has made huge strides over the past decade in learning to understand what people are saying and how to respond. It can even best human experts when it comes to reading lips. But body language is much messier. To illustrate the problem Sheikh likes to show two close-up photographs of tennis player Rafael Nadal. In one, Nadal is experiencing a moment of anguish, in the other, ecstasy. But with just his face, itâ€™s hard to know which is which. To clarify we need to zoom out, to read his entire posture, his hands, the full picture of a human. Something as simple as a stare can convey anger, lust, or confusion with only the subtlest of changes to the rest of your body.The pillars of body language are facial expressions, gestures, posture, and gaze. Humans have tried since the beginning to work these elements into our digital communications. Emoticons were the most basic. A wink or a frown, while crude, can add an emotional effect to an email that would be difficult to impart with words. This was followed by decades of work on digital avatars with bodies that could express our intentions.In the mid 1980s Habitat, a game developed by LucasArts, let players use keyboard commands to change their avatarsâ€™ facial expressions. In the early 1990s, startups like &ampnbspTraveler, DreamScape, WorldsAway, and The Palace all competed for users to populate their virtual worlds. WorldsAway users could walk and gesture and talk through speech bubbles. Later worlds, like There.com, added voice chat, and used the volume of your voice to activate certain gestures.                                     Screenshots from Onlive Traveler, &ampnbspThe Palace, and Habitat - courtesy Bruce Damer The dot-com crash wiped out most of this generationâ€™s virtual worlds. ""By 2000, it was all dead,"" said Bruce Damer, a historian of the period. There were a few exceptions to that rule. Dedicated communities of millions did coalesce around virtual worlds like The Sims and Second Life. Avatars in Second Life had 19 opposable joints, and users could manipulate them to create unique gestures. This led to a lot of awkward movements, as parodied in this&ampnbspclassic YouTube video. Body language was such a desired commodity that users even paid for ""animation overrides,"" or AOs, a sort of software mod that replaced standard movements with specially scripted ones.The creators of these virtual worlds had imagined that one day everyone would use avatars to meet, shop, and fall in love online. But a year after Second Life launched, Facebook began to percolate across college campuses. It was a sort of evolutionary reset. In place of a highly detailed 3D avatar, your online identity was a photo and some text.With Facebookâ€™s purchase of Oculus in 2014, those two approaches to a social internet are coming together. Facebook and others in the VR space are returning to the pursuit of highly virtual avatars that had been largely abandoned with the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Only this time, the technology is ready. The sensors and cameras needed for good positional tracking had been developed inside gaming consoles and smartphones, ready to capture not just our voices and keyboard commands, but the actual movements of our bodies. Instead of ""manipulating a character like a marionette,"" says Ebbe Altberg, CEO of Second Life creator Linden Lab. In VR, ""itâ€™s like wearing the skin of the avatar.""             Facebook avatars for its social VR software In 2015 Mike Booth, a 20-year veteran of the gaming industry, went to see a demo of a new virtual reality experience. He was invited by his friend, Jason Holtman, another gaming industry vet, who had recently secured a job at Oculus. Booth had vast experience with cutting-edge graphics and multiplayer games that let people interact online. But what he saw that day blew him away. It was a demo of Toybox, a simple social VR experience that puts two people together in a virtual playpen. ""There were these floating blue hands and head that looked nothing like Jason. But it was Jason, because it picked up his biological motion, his nuances, the way his head nods.""Holtmanâ€™s avatar had no body, no facial features, no hair, none of the intricate details that Booth was used to from his work in the gaming industry. ""Iâ€™ve been making video games for 20 years, and Iâ€™ve seen all kinds of stuff. The highest level triple AAA most realistic graphics, all that jazz. And all my career has been multiplayer online, so Iâ€™m very used to being with other people in online space. But that experience with Jason, I was literally speechless, and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s driven me to do social VR.""Booth is now leading Facebookâ€™s efforts to create social VR, an extension of the service used by more than a billion people every day. The teamâ€™s first challenge was to craft avatars. ""We thought, â€˜Hey letâ€™s just use photographs and rebuild a three-dimensional model of your actual head.â€™"" In theory, everyone with a cell phone or webcam could then easily get a detailed, personalized representation of themselves. In practice, the idea was a disaster. A steely eyed photograph, stretched over a humanoid skull moving semi-naturally created, Booth says, a ""dead head.""This problem, dubbed the Uncanny Valley, is common across the film and gaming industries, and even crops up in robotics: people generally like representations of humans the more lifelike they become. But cross a certain threshold, and suddenly we find that same character spooky. Part of our brain believes itâ€™s a real person, while other parts are screaming itâ€™s not.             Oculus avatars inside Toybox ""If you take something thatâ€™s remotely realistic, and you add that biological motion, you reach that Uncanny Valley much quicker than we expected,"" says Booth. ""Theyâ€™re not breathing right, their eyes donâ€™t move right, they donâ€™t look in the right spot. Theyâ€™re psychotic!""The very limited avatars Oculus had crafted for Toybox were a clever hack around this issue. ""Number one, itâ€™s blue â€” not a biological color. The eyes are hidden behind a visor, there is no mouth that animates,"" says Booth. ""When those cues arenâ€™t there, you focus on the cues that work.""""I wanted my friends to be able to smile or look confused.""But for Facebook, Booth wanted something more appealing than a blue bobblehead. ""I really wanted to get eye contact, lip-synch, and expressions. I wanted my friends to be able to smile or look confused,"" says Booth. Most importantly, he wanted users to be able to recognize their close friends.In April of this year, Booth and his team revealed an early experiment. They took the floating blue hands and head from Toybox, but allowed users to draw on personal details. Booth was distinguished by his receding hairline, goatee, and glasses. He sketched a tie for himself and attached it below his head, at the bottom of a nonexistent neck. It was rudimentary, a literal line drawing, but it added a world of character to his avatar.Six months later, at Oculus Connect in October, Boothâ€™s team had made huge strides. Facebookâ€™s avatars now had arms and torsos. They could make eye contact, and their mouths moved to a rough approximation of their words when they spoke. The highlight was what Booth calls ""gestural emotes,"" emotions triggered by specific postures. Booth compares it to the overblown movements of vaudeville actors. Bring your hands up to your cheeks and your avatar will gape like Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone. Pump your fists above your head and your avatar will break into a huge grin.To get to this point, Booth and his team had to fudge reality. The position of an avatarâ€™s arms is just an educated guess based on the movement of their hands and head. So is the direction of your gaze. In the virtual space you can see other peopleâ€™s arms, but not your own â€” the engineers figured seeing your digital arms in one position, but feeling your physical arms in another, would have been too jarring. ""Weâ€™re making judgement calls on what we think we can get away with that will enhance the feeling of being there with a real person,"" explains Booth. In the absence of technology that can truly capture body language, the team is building its best approximation. ""The science wasnâ€™t in yet, so Iâ€™m just gonna wing it.""             AltSpaceVR avatars Two of the most prominent platforms emerging for social VR alongside Facebook are AltspaceVR, an independent startup, and Oculus, which is owned by Facebook, but has its own avatar system. Interestingly, both take nearly opposite approaches to conveying body language. They studiously avoid the tricks Booth and his team use to improvise the things they cannot track: arms, mouth movement, and gaze. Instead, they stick almost religiously to what they can track with great fidelity, trusting our imagination to fill in the rest.A few weeks after F8, I chatted with Eric Romo, the founder and CEO of AltspaceVR. I was in New York wearing an HTC Vive headset and holding a pair of motion controllers. Romo was in California doing the same. A pair of laser-emitting boxes affixed to the walls mapped the rooms we were in and tracked our motion, allowing Romo and I to walk, wave, and interact as if we were in the same space, and not 3,000 miles apart. If we got too close to one another in the virtual space, I felt legitimately uncomfortable. It was easier to avoid talking over one another, because hands gestures and head position provided conversational cues.Compared with Facebookâ€™s avatars, our body language was limited. We were like childrenâ€™s action figures, given just enough mobility to spark the imagination. Our bodies had arms and hands, but they stayed locked at our sides. Our actual hand position was represented by a pair of controllers floating in front of our avatars. We had legs, but we couldnâ€™t walk around. Instead we used a cursor to teleport from one position to another. Our heads moved, but our gaze did not. Our mouths didnâ€™t attempt to track the sounds of our words.We were like childrenâ€™s action figures, given just enough mobility to spark the imaginationRomo explained that, for now at least, AltspaceVR was staying away from the methods Facebook is using to approximate the movement of your arms or mouth. ""The research on this from the last decade is that itâ€™s easier to make an emotional connection with an abstract avatar where everything you see is tracked and rendered correctly, versus trying to make an emotional connection with a very detailed avatar that is not being captured in the right way,"" he explained.As more accurate tracking technology becomes available, AltspaceVR plans to add it in. Right now, for example, anyone with a Leap Motion controller can have highly detailed hands, complete with flexible fingers, in place of two floating game controllers. When comedians perform for big crowds in AltspaceVR, they can wear a full body suit, allowing them to act out physical gags.Oculus takes a similar approach. ""We were very clear early on that we wanted to avoid the temptation to add motion above and beyond what we could do with our track data,"" said Mike Howard, product manager at Oculus, during a recent talk. ""There is a lot we could fake, from elbows, to knees, to the mouth, to eye movementâ€¦ at best they distract from the real movement that the user is trying to convey, and at worst they get it wrong, and they donâ€™t match whatâ€™s being said."" The first ground rule of avatar design for Oculus is simple. ""Leave it to the human brain, donâ€™t fake it.""             Cameras and sensors inside the Panoptic Studio Yaser Sheikh, director of the Panoptic Studio, has nothing against cartoon avatars. ""I think this is great work, and itâ€™s certainly what the first wave of social VR will be like. But my personal research goal, and the goal of our lab in Pittsburgh, is to do photorealistic social VR,"" he explained. ""It should feel as if, when I put on the headset, and you put on the headset in NY, we are in the same room, you look exactly the way you do, you move exactly the way you do.""By feeding thousands of hours of social interaction from the Panoptic Lab into deep learning algorithms, Sheikh believes he can teach computers to understand the subtleties of our body language, just as others have taught computers to understand spoken language, or to read lips. ""When we look at a video of another person, the amount of information that hits our eyes and reaches our brain is actually quite impoverished. The reason we are able to suck out so much information from this is because we have a lifetime of experience interacting with people, and a rich repository of data in our mind,"" he explained. ""The goal is to give machines that kind of imagination, that repository of data to draw on.""The better computers get at understanding our bodies, the less hardware tracking will require. ""Obviously, as much as we want to, weâ€™re not going to have 500 cameras set up in everyoneâ€™s living room,"" said Sheikh with a laugh. ""What we want to do in the lab is get the sort of data that we need to build representations that will then drive measurement from much reduced capture setups, fewer cameras, and so on.""""The real promise of VR, in my opinion, is that it holds the potential of allowing us to build and grow relationships from distances.""Once social VR cracks the elaborate code and avatars are as convincing as actual people, a whole world of possibilities opens up: imagine an online dating service that lets you converse with potential matches across candlelit table before you meet up in real life. Or playing poker with a group of friends spread across the country, and being able to tell if a buddy is bluffing from his body language. Sheikhâ€™s extended family lives in Abu Dhabi, and he sees social VR as a way to strengthen those ties. ""The bond with the grandparents and the extended family just isnâ€™t the same as if we were there. The real promise of VR, in my opinion, is that it holds the potential of allowing us to build and grow relationships from distances.""Of course, with convincing body language now a matter of computer code, the person across from you may not be what they seem. Imagine youâ€™re in a boring meeting with a lot of people: in real life it would be rude to walk out the door. In VR you can sneak away, while your avatar stays sitting, nodding intelligently, and paying attention. ""That autopilot version of a person Iâ€™m sure everyone would love to have,"" says Sheikh.This kind of embellishment could be used for good. The Virtual Human Interaction Lab found students were more attentive and retained more material when the avatar representing the teacher was coded so that it appeared to each member of the class to be gazing directly at them. No regular teacher could simultaneously be looking at every student, but in VR, those limitations donâ€™t exist.             Trajectory reconstruction of the author's dance moves inside the Panoptic Studio After my visit to the Panoptic Studio, I wanted to try the cutting edge of social VR for myself. So a few months later I traveled to Facebookâ€™s headquarters in Menlo Park, where I got a demo of its Toybox software. Inside a windowless room optimized for virtual reality, I donned the Oculus headset and an assistant placed the Touch controllers in my hand. Now I was across a table from my partner, a pair of floating blue hands and a head.In Toybox, I had the visceral sensation of being with another human being, but the world had none of the constraints or consequences you find in your living room. We could smash a vase with our slingshot, then snap a finger and it would be back. At one point we lowered the effects of gravity, and sent our pile of blocks floating in every direction. They scattered to the four corners of our playspace, and a few minutes later, reappeared neatly where they had begun.My most vivid memory is of the moment we worked together to pick up a castle made of blocks. It required delicate coordination, and the physics of the wobbly structure pressed between our virtual fingers was so convincing that I could almost feel the weight in my hands.There is an irony to to the notion that in the near future, some of our most exciting social interactions might happen when weâ€™re shutting out the world. I imagined my own sons getting lost in this fantastic universe, and how wonderful a tool it could be for connecting if they found themselves living apart. Conversely I thought of how strange it would feel to come home find them sitting across from each other in our living room, each wearing a VR headset, alone together in another world.We are social animals, and there is something intoxicating about being with another person in a virtual realm where earthly rules donâ€™t apply. VR promises to connect us in a more intimate way than any technology has before, allowing for new forms of collaboration and creation. Eventually our avatars may come to feel like richer representations of who we are, or want to be. At that point, weâ€™ll have to be careful not to get lost in our virtual worlds, and forget the bodies weâ€™re leaving behind.Editor: Michael Zelenko Design: James Bareham",2016.0,12.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

",2016-11-29,"      The Verge 2021In celebration of our 5th anniversary, this month weâ€™re publishing a series of interviews with innovative leaders about what the next five years hold. To read more about this series, read our editor Nilay Patelâ€™s introduction here.In the years since Trayvon Martinâ€™s shooting death in 2012, thousands of people â€” and, particularly, people of color â€” have turned out in the streets and online to cry out against police violence, and demanded accountability. The collective resistance of those protests coalesced early on into what is now known as the Black Lives Matter movement. BLM, further fueled by the deaths of Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, and countless others, has become one of the most vibrant political forces of our time. It has also called into question what it means to protest in 2016 and how Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and other social platforms can be used to effectively shine light on injustice, and spark change. One of the Black Lives Matter movementâ€™s most prominent voices is 31-year-old DeRay Mckesson. With his now-iconic blue vest, Mckesson, now the interim chief of Human Capital for Baltimore City Public Schools, has balanced using his platform online and off in order to draw attention to matters such as public safety and law enforcement reform. He has protested against police violence in places like Ferguson, Missouri Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Charleston, South Carolina. Through Campaign Zero, he and other BLM activists designed a policy plan calling for police reform. He even ran for Baltimore mayor this year, and though he lost, he drew widespread attention to his effort to bring BLM to the halls of government, where real change happens.Last month, we sat down with DeRay in New York City to discuss Black Lives Matter and the future of activism, both in the streets and on the internet. The InterviewOver the last two years, youâ€™ve become an activist, organizer, and even mayoral candidate. Where do you think youâ€™ll be in 2021?The movement has created a critical mass of people who understand that thereâ€™s a crisis. Two years ago, there were people who thought that there was a problem in Ferguson, [but] they did not yet accept that there was a problem across the country. We won that battle. The next part of the work is to create a critical mass of people who know what the solutions are and have the skills to implement them. In five years, Iâ€™m hopeful that Iâ€™d be in a place, as an organizer, where we created that critical mass. Iâ€™ll probably still be doing work around education and kids because that has been so much of my career. Iâ€™m also hopeful that weâ€™ll be celebrating some of the accomplishments around criminal justice reform, and we will have figured out how to use technology to build community differently.Subscribe to our newsletter so you don't miss the rest of the Verge 2021 interviews. Terms apply.SubscribeAs an activist, you use Instagram and Twitter. How are activists using these tools, and how do you see that changing?I love Twitter. I think about Twitter as the friend thatâ€™s always awake. Itâ€™s why I tweet so much. Iâ€™m interested to see which of the platforms will be the first one that allows people to build skills. Right now, mostly, itâ€™s about information sharing. We havenâ€™t seen a platform really be [about] skill building, so Iâ€™m hoping thatâ€™ll come next. Itâ€™s been interesting to see Snapchat grow and change, [and] I think that in the coming years weâ€™ll see that. Iâ€™m not one of the people who is a Twitter doomsday person. I think that weâ€™ll see the golden days of Twitter ahead.   â€œWe arenâ€™t born woke, something wakes us up, and for so many people, what woke them up was a tweet or a Facebook post.â€�     I think that we have to be open to new ways of organizing and new ways of building community. Iâ€™m mindful that we arenâ€™t born woke, something wakes us up, and for so many people, what woke them up was a tweet or a Facebook post, an Instagram post, a picture. I never criticize people who [others] deem to be Twitter activists, or hashtag activists, because I know that telling the truth is often a tough act, no matter where you tell that truth. I think thatâ€™s important. I think that weâ€™ll continue to see the platforms push and redefine the way we organize.In terms of the new organizing, you think about how you can use people on Slack and mobilize them, you think about how we can spread messages on Twitter. I think that weâ€™re just at the beginning of seeing the power of technology to really push in the social justice and the equity space. I think that moving forward in terms of what the solutions look like, I think weâ€™ll see platforms like Twilio be really important. I think weâ€™ll see these sort of quieter, seemingly, platforms take a primary role.                      Is it on Silicon Valley companies to address issues of social injustice, institutional racism, et cetera? Or should that be more the task of the government?      I think the reality is that thereâ€™s a role for everybody to play in the work of social justice and that we have to organize everybody. That means that Silicon Valley has to be organized, the fashion industry has to be organized, the formerly incarcerated have to be organized, the teachers. We have to figure out how to build a critical mass that is different from the critical masses weâ€™ve tried to build before and leveraging peopleâ€™s skills and talents as we think about issues of equity injustice. I think that Silicon Valley and technology can play a huge role in redefining what community looks like and how people come together and what authentic relationships look like, but that is not only their burden. We also have to be as organized on the inside as we are on the outside.                How will institutions like local government and Congress use these tools to engage with people on the ground? â€œIf you get killed by a police officer in America and a newspaper does not write about it, you are not in the data set. That is wild.â€� I think that one of the things that weâ€™ve learned is that thereâ€™s no one solution. Body cameras can be implemented effectively as a part of a comprehensive set of solutions, but alone they are not the win. The White House is actually doing some interesting research around body cameras, about how we can use the audio from body cameras to detect aggression in officers before the trauma happens. Right now, we think about body cameras [in terms of] post-trauma. Something bad happens, we look at the video. But could we use the audio? I think thatâ€™s fascinating. I think weâ€™ll see many more things like that start to come to the fore around how we can use technology to hold people accountable.The other thing is about data. I know there are a lot of incredible coders and people in the tech space who are trying to help us think about some big data questions. If youâ€™ve heard any number about police violence at all, ever, it is all from local media reports. That means that if you get killed by a police officer in America and a newspaper does not write about it, you are not in the data set. That is wild. There are some towns that donâ€™t have newspapers. If the police kill somebody in that town, they just arenâ€™t in the data set.I [also] think there are a lot of data questions about bail, about sentencing. Most people donâ€™t realize that the homicide rate in cities actually includes the people that the police kill. In places like Albuquerque, one in three people killed in Albuquerque is actually killed by the police. But if you just look at the homicide rate you donâ€™t know that. Iâ€™m most interested in how we think about big data surfacing some of these things that have just not come to the forum because the government does not have the resources to bring them forward.                Is there something you would create yourself to remedy some of these situations in the next five years?If I could create one thing in the next five years around remedying the data issues, it would be a massive crowdsourced big data project that got volunteers from across the world to sift through some of these issues. Right now, weâ€™re working on creating a public database of all the public information for all the elected officials in the country.  Weâ€™re working on it. Weâ€™ll do it. You should be able to look up in any town and city who the elected officials are. You canâ€™t look up what the bail amounts are and how bail is set. There are some big data questions. I would make a big data initiative around social justice that was also crowdsourced.In your mind, is there a Black Lives Matter in 2021? Is it a social movement? A political movement? Something grassroots versus something happening in Washington? Is it economic? Or is it all of the above?I think that in five years, the movement will be a comprehensive space. Iâ€™m mindful that the movement is young. When people talk about what we now call ""the civil rights movement,"" that was a decade. We are two years into this. I think thereâ€™s so much more work to be done. I think that in five years weâ€™ll see some really focused economic organizing, that weâ€™ll continue to see people pressing in the criminal justice space, and that weâ€™ll be able to reflect on some key wins and talk about some legislative successes as well. I think itâ€™ll be interesting to see in five years what the next president has done, and what the commitment to criminal justice reform in safety and communities looks like.            Speaking of safety and space being open to conversations with a multitude of people, how do you ensure that the people who are part of the movement are safe on these online communities?The issue of abuse online is close to me. I get death threats. There was a movie theater that got evacuated because somebody tweeted that they were going to shoot me. I blocked 19,000 people on Twitter alone. Most of my lifeâ€™s information is public. I got a text one day from a hacker who texted me all of my credit card information. Itâ€™s close to me. I think that the online space is in so many ways trying to figure out what is abuse and what isnâ€™t abuse. â€œI blocked 19,000 people on Twitter alone.â€� Twitter has made some important inroads but has a long way to go. Facebook, the same thing. In five years, we will see a more nuanced and a more consistent vision of what safety should look like in online communities. If I disagree vehemently, is that abuse? If I call you a curse word, is that abuse? Is there some in-between? It is murky right now. The only people having the abuse conversations are people who are impacted by it. The people who are developing the spaces arenâ€™t engaging in public dialogue about it. They are just sort of doing things with their platforms. That is not helpful or productive.How would you have companies like Facebook resolve that problem?I think that engaging in public conversation or a broader group discussion about what safety looks like online would be really important. Iâ€™ve talked to the folks at Twitter about safety on the Twitter platform. I know that theyâ€™re actually working quietly behind the scenes on making some changes. I do think thereâ€™s a benefit to hearing from people who use the platform often about what it would look like. Facebook, itâ€™s not always clear why they suspend some posts [and] why they deactivate some accounts. On Twitter, thereâ€™s a fine line between what is actually the thing that gets your account suspended versus the thing thatâ€™s going to get your account deleted. Moving forward, we will actually see much more nuance and much more consistency around how these things are applied.Do you envision people generally becoming more aware of the fights against institutional inequality in the years to come?In five years, the definition of what it means to be active and aware will be different. Weâ€™ve already started to push the space and say that a protesterâ€™s not only somebody who goes into the street. A protester is not only somebody who disrupts a board meeting. An organizer is not only somebody who sits in the basement of a church every Wednesday. We have pushed the boundaries. When I think about what it means to protest, a protester is somebody who tells the truth in public and there are many ways to do that.Technology has opened up a new frontier in that space. I do think that more people will be woke. More people will be aware, but how we measure that will be different. Weâ€™ll see authentic relationships continue to build and blossom in digital spaces. [They wonâ€™t] replace offline work, offline organizing, or offline relationships, but enhance them and allow for more connection, a deeper connection, and more sustained connection.            What worries you as you look forward?I worry sometimes that we have forgotten how to imagine what is possible. You think about things like slavery. It took a lot of imagination, some real mental leaps to be like, ""These people are worthless, these people are worth more. Weâ€™re going to put them in chains."" In concocting the problems, people were really imaginative in the worst ways. Weâ€™re in these moments where weâ€™re like, ""Okay, the problems are bad. Letâ€™s figure out how to undo them."" People are all of a sudden unimaginative. You say something like, ""Give every kid born in a city in poverty a library,"" and people are like, ""We could never do that! We could never afford it!"" That is just so mind-blowing to me, that people just lost their imagination. â€œIn concocting the problems, people were really imaginative in the worst ways.â€� I also think that something that happens in the social justice spaces is this idea that if you donâ€™t organize with or like me, then youâ€™re not an organizer. We have to continue to create spaces for people to open up new spaces. That there is no one way to do this work. Thereâ€™s no one way to be someone who cares about justice or equity. Thereâ€™s no one way to use tech platforms. If we had used Twitter the way that all the articles say that you use Twitter, we wouldnâ€™t be here. We use it in a different way. We use Vine in a different way. You think about the beginning of the protests. It was before Periscope. It was before you could upload videos on Twitter. We were really patchworking platforms to make them work for us.Iâ€™ve met so many young people who feel like thereâ€™s only one entrance to the work now. That if they donâ€™t do it this way, then itâ€™s not real. I worry that we might be missing out on some amazingly radical ways of organizing that we havenâ€™t thought about.You still sound very optimistic. Are you?I believe that our tomorrows can be better than our todays. My sense of hope is rooted so much in my time as a teacher. I taught sixth grade math in East Area Brooklyn. I think every day about fighting for building a world that is worthy of the kids that I taught. That is real to me. The other piece is that I grew up in Baltimore. Both my parents were drug addicts. My father raised us. My mother left when I was three. I say that because I grew up in so many ways in the community of recovery. I saw people put their lives back together in ways that they did not think they could. I saw people come back from what they thought was their most broken to be whole in a different way and to be sound and to be loving and to be caring in ways that they had not yet imagined at the time. Those two things give me the sense of hope. It helped me believe and understand that some of this work is the slow painful work but it pays off in the end. The last thing is that in protests I met incredible people. I met so many people across the country who did not understand their own power, who did not believe the sound of their own voice and they found it over the last two years. Every time I meet another person like that, it reminds me that the people are there. We just have to figure out how to organize. The people exist, the passion exists, and we can do this.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",2016.0,11.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,
15,Gene editing will transform cancer treatment,"
Elizabeth Lopatto
",2016-11-22,"      The Verge 2021In celebration of our 5th anniversary, this month weâ€™re publishing a series of interviews with innovative leaders about what the next five years hold. To read more about this series, read our editor Nilay Patelâ€™s introduction here.You may have heard of the gene-editing technique CRISPR-cas9, often simply called CRISPR. Introduced in 2012, CRISPR works like a pair of scissors to cut DNA, inserting or reordering bits of genetic code with remarkable, science-fiction-like results: CRISPR can help create mosquitoes that donâ€™t transmit malaria, or be used to breed unusually muscular beagles, or even create mini pigs. In humans, the technology is being tested to battle cancer â€” by removing patientsâ€™ immune cells, editing them, and reinserting the weaponized cells into the body to hunt cancer. One of the leading scientists who developed the technique is Jennifer Doudna, a biochemist at the University of California, Berkeley. With the help of Emmanuelle Charpentier, Martin Jinek, and Krzysztof Chylinski, Doudna adapted the system that bacteria use to defeat viruses to create the much-vaunted cell-editing technique. We sat down with Doudna in October to discuss just what CRISPR might mean for the future of science, and disease research. While CRISPR marks a landmark breakthrough, the technology also presents plenty of concerns about genetic modification â€”&ampnbspsome ethical, some practical â€” and Doudna has made a habit of stepping out from among the ranks of other scientists to discuss those concerns with the public. We talked to Doudna about the possibility of using CRISPR to combat disease, to help preserve threatened species, and how close we are to creating a real-life Jurassic Park.  The InterviewWhatâ€™s the public perception of CRISPR?The public perception of CRISPR is [that] itâ€™s in its early stages. People have heard about it. Theyâ€™ve heard of the acronym often. Iâ€™ll get into taxis and Iâ€™ll have a taxi driver say, ""Oh, you work on CRISPR. Yeah, Iâ€™ve read about that."" People are still trying to understand what itâ€™s all about and what it means for them, personally, and for the future.           â€œCRISPR has&ampnbspalready altered the way scientists do research.â€� Itâ€™s very hard for people, generally, to appreciate that new technologies always take time to have an impact in a real-world sense. What weâ€™re seeing with the CRISPR technology for gene editing is that the field has moved remarkably quickly in the scientific sense. I mean, itâ€™s only sort of a four-year-old technology and itâ€™s &ampnbspalready altered the way scientists do research. Itâ€™s altered the commercial landscape â€” lots of companies are using this technology now. But itâ€™s really hard for people to appreciate just how long it really takes to do something like create a therapeutic [agent]. A very common discussion that I have with people outside the scientific community is, How long is it going to be until we have a technology from this, or a real therapeutic [agent] from this? An approved treatment, or even a cure? You know, weâ€™re probably still a decade out from that, realistically, because itâ€™ll take time to ensure that itâ€™s safe and effective.          Subscribe to our newsletter so you don't miss the rest of the Verge 2021 interviews. Terms apply.SubscribeMedical research moves very slowly. Weâ€™re only just starting to see the first human trials of CRISPR technology. What do you imagine will be happening in 2021?The next five years will be extremely interesting in this space. By 2021, we will certainly see more clinical trials. Right now the trials that are approved are all for cancer. Theyâ€™re doing a particular type of editing that might be impactful in treating cancer â€” namely being able to program a patientâ€™s own immune cells to target and destroy their cancer cells. Thatâ€™s an exciting opportunity, but going forward we will see increasing efforts, and I hope clinical trials, to address genetic diseases of the blood, of the eye, of the liver. Then probably farther down the road, diseases that affect other tissue. Iâ€™m thinking Duchenne muscular dystrophy is one that people talk about a lot. Cystic fibrosis is another thatâ€™s discussed a lot.                      You mentioned blood disorders. Perhaps you can give me a sense of how that particular area of research is going to progress in the next five years. What sorts of trials could we see for sickle cell anemia, for instance?The gene-editing technology that is available today is already sufficient to cure the defect that causes sickle cell anemia in cells that are cultured in the laboratory. Thatâ€™s been the case already for a couple of years. The challenge is how to take that and deploy it in a way thatâ€™s going to be effective in patients. To do that, gene-editing technology really needs to get a very high level of editing in blood cells. We need to be able to do it in blood stem cells, so that they can actually repopulate a patientâ€™s blood system with cells that donâ€™t have the sickle cell trait. The exciting thing right now is that thereâ€™s clearly a big effort in this space in many labs. I think that weâ€™ll just continue to see a lot of progress in this area.          Itâ€™s always hard to predict exactly how long itâ€™ll take to do something like this, but from talking to my clinical colleagues who really think deeply about this sort of challenge, weâ€™re all hopeful that within the next two to three years we will see advances in the technology that will make it possible to initiate clinical trials. Whether that happens will depend a lot on how things unfold, really, over the next couple of years.            For a disease like cystic fibrosis, for instance, what does the future look like if we decide, ""Okay, weâ€™re going to treat this in such a way that genetic mutations we introduce wonâ€™t be passed on to children?""Various labs working on various model systems of cystic fibrosis have had success in the laboratory. Theyâ€™ve been able to use gene editing in lab-grown tissue samples that reflect the tissue in patients that have cystic fibrosis. We know the technology has this capability. Now we need to, again, bridge the gap between what goes on in the lab and what weâ€™d like to be able to do in the clinic, and be able to do it safely. Thereâ€™s clearly a lot of work that needs to be done, but itâ€™s an exciting time because you can start to see how the pieces could fall into place to make that possible.Thereâ€™s a way of applying CRISPR to embryos that we havenâ€™t fully explored, in part because of some of the ethical issues and in part because we donâ€™t totally know what thatâ€™s going to do.What might altering embryos mean for diseases like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy? â€œThere are four countries that have approved human embryo experiments using the CRISPR gene-editing technology.â€� One thing thatâ€™s very interesting right now is that there are four countries that have approved human embryo experiments using the CRISPR gene-editing technology.Weâ€™re just talking about using this tool in very early embryos to find out, how effective is it, is it safe, [and] does it have the desired properties for making changes to the human genome that would be, in principle, effective at curing disease? Depending on how those experiments work out, there will be increasing interest, and probably pressure, for certain kinds of applications of gene editing in embryos to go forward. This is why itâ€™s critical that we have an open conversation about this right now, even though weâ€™re not there today with this technology. How do we ensure an ethical path forward?There are no easy answers, but I do feel there may be reasons that, in the future â€” assuming that the technology can be shown to be safe and effective in embryos for certain applications â€” we may come to a time when we say, ""It might not be ethical to not use it for those uses in certain cases."" Again, this will really depend on how things unfold with the technology coupled with a responsible discussion about responsible use.Is there anything that frightens you about this technology, about the power of it?When I think about what makes me nervous about this technology, it really comes down to how little we really understand the function of genes, especially the interactions between genes in our own genomes. [For] humans, but for other organisms, too. One of the big unknowns is if we were to deploy this technology to make a permanent change in the germline of an embryo, would there be unintended consequences of that change that might not really show up for dozens of years? How do you even think about testing such a thing? I donâ€™t know. Could you do it in animals? Maybe, but at some point you have to actually try it in a person if youâ€™re going in that direction. Just thinking about how to do that, how to do even the research that would be needed to provide the data that would allow us to make an informed decision is a challenging question.            Do you ever worry that there might be folks with the capability of using this kind of technology unethically?It does concern me, definitely, but frankly not maybe any more that it concerns me that we have nuclear capabilities. We have other technologies that are clearly very powerful as well, and can also be employed by people that might not have the same ethical concerns that weâ€™d like to see in those decisions. Yes, itâ€™s a concern, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s unique to this technology.Weâ€™ve been talking mostly about humans. When we consider modifying crops or animals, do the challenges change? Are the risks and benefits potentially different? â€œWe can now, if we have enough information, just introduce the desired change to a gene precisely.â€� In terms of the technology, the challenges are similar but the details are different. For example, in plants the excitement is that you can potentially introduce changes to plant DNA much more quickly, and certainly much more accurately than has been possible in the past. That means that instead of having to do something like mutagenize seeds with chemicals and then try to select for those that give rise to plants with the desired trait â€” which is frankly whatâ€™s done currently â€” we can now, if we have enough information, just introduce the desired change to a gene precisely and not have to make or guess about what other changes might be happening elsewhere in the DNA of that organism. Thatâ€™s very attractive, but again it comes down to delivery. How do we deliver editing molecules into plants? Very challenging. Plants have a cell wall so it makes it even harder to get into plant cells.Really what the CRISPR tool does is introduce a break into DNA at a particular place. Then the cell takes over and repairs the break. Thatâ€™s where the editing actually occurs. In plants itâ€™s not so easy to control that. Itâ€™s a challenge in animals, too, but in plants we donâ€™t know very much about how that actually works. Getting a handle on that in the future will be a big effort on the research side.How long do you imagine it would be before we start to introduce things like modified mosquitoes into the environment?Itâ€™ll happen in the short term. Thereâ€™s a lot of interest, on the part of foundations especially, that are thinking about, ""How do we deploy technologies to avoid the spread of disease?"" Diseases like Zika, and dengue, and others that are insect-borne have very huge negative impacts on humans. Thinking creatively about how to use new technologies to help us mitigate these diseases is really critical. Again, it has to be done with an open-eyed approach to the potential risks of deploying these organisms and ensuring that appropriate guidelines and regulatory procedures are followed to try to avoid any unintended environmental consequences.This can be tested by mixing populations of mosquitoes in a controlled environment and just watching over time what happens. This is just the law of natural selection, right? If an organism has a reproductive disadvantage in a population, then it will tend to be out-competed by its peers over time. Or the other way around, too. If it has a reproductive advantage then it will tend to over-populate an environment over time, other things being equal. Thatâ€™s already being seen with these modified mosquitoes. As these experiments are conducted in controlled settings, the hope is that scientists will get more sophisticated about the way theyâ€™re employing technologies that control properties of mosquitoes that might be beneficial to humans and ensuring that those properties are maintained over the long term in those populations, but without unintended, undesired consequences.            Are there broader applications? Could we potentially modify animals that exist now and sort of back-form a dinosaur, or back-form a mammoth?Thereâ€™s a lot of interest in whatâ€™s called ""de-extinction"": the idea that you could bring back an organism that is no longer walking the Earth by using gene editing to make modifications to a genome of an existing organism reintroduce genes that have been lost within the extinction process. There are various efforts to do things like bring back the woolly mammoth. Itâ€™s not quite a dinosaur, but it would be pretty cool if you could do that. Iâ€™ve also talked a bit to Beth Shapiro down at University of California, Santa Cruz. She studies animals like bears, and evolutionary patterns of bears, and also in birds. There are opportunities with those kinds of organisms. â€œWe donâ€™t really know the DNA sequence that would encode a dinosaur.â€� Whether you could really bring back a dinosaur, thatâ€™s a much harder challenge. We donâ€™t really know the DNA sequence that would encode a dinosaur. In Jurassic Park, you may remember that the premise of Michael Crichtonâ€™s story was that there were insects trapped in resin that contained blood from dinosaurs that had DNA still available for sequencing. Unfortunately, DNA is a chemical that doesnâ€™t last 65 million years. I think being able to do that is not so likely, but maybe itâ€™s possible to piece together information that we have about amphibians, about birds, it might be possible to start walking in that direction. I donâ€™t know how close you could get to a real dinosaur, but certainly weâ€™ll learn a lot about the genetic traits that are encoded in DNA that give rise to some of the traits that we think dinosaurs had.Would you say youâ€™re an optimist about the future?Iâ€™m an optimist about the future, yes.The thing I like to point out is that a lot of the technologies that have come to the fore over the last few decades, and the CRISPR gene-editing tool is in this category, too, have come about due to fundamental research. Rather than a focused effort to invent or discover a technology or an idea or an insight, these kinds of things often come about from scientists who are working in a seemingly different area of science, who through circumstances and just paying attention to their data come across insights that lead to either new technologies or new fundamental understanding of nature.I like to point that out because thereâ€™s been a real push in the US and elsewhere in the world for scientists to be more applied in their work, to focus on a particular problem: Letâ€™s cure cancer, letâ€™s have a brain initiative that allows us to understand consciousness or something like that. Itâ€™s not that those arenâ€™t valuable as well, but I think we donâ€™t want to get too far away from the idea that we donâ€™t know, really, enough about our natural world to know where the next insights or technologies are coming from. I hope our new administration will support fundamental discovery science that allows scientists and researchers in the US and around the world to positively impact human health.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",2016.0,11.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

Casey Newton
",2016-11-21,"      The Verge 2021In celebration of our 5th anniversary, this month weâ€™re publishing a series of interviews with innovative leaders about what the next five years hold. To read more about this series, read our editor Nilay Patelâ€™s introduction here.Marc Andreessen may be the most dedicated optimist in Silicon Valley. During a year when the publicâ€™s attention was often focused on international conflict, mass shootings, and a bitter election, the co-founder of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has insistently pointed toward progress. Until it fell silent in September, Andreessenâ€™s hyperactive Twitter feed served as a guide to the good news: people rising out of poverty, the surprising durability of the US economy, and all manner of fast-growing tech products and services.And then, on September 24th, the account froze. â€œTaking a Twitter break!â€� he tweeted, before deleting the rest of his tweets. He has never said why â€” and, when we met in his offices on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, he declined to say much beyond the fact that his seat on Facebookâ€™s board had presented him with a conflict.Plenty of subjects stress Andreessen out â€” he believes the next election will somehow be even more contentious than the one we just survived. But generally speaking, he is as optimistic as heâ€™s ever been, whether the subject is job creation, the future of autonomous vehicles, or the remarkable progress in the quest to build flying cars. The InterviewWhatâ€™s made you feel optimistic lately?A bunch of things. Itâ€™s honestly hard to not be an optimist in this job, because we get 2,000 founders a year who come in here, sit in that chair right there, and they just tell us everything. They unspool the future to us, and theyâ€™re optimistic or they wouldnâ€™t be here. Then all the new ideas.         I wonder whether people outside a firm like this would be more optimistic if they could see and hear all of that stuff. Iâ€™m not sure. Weâ€™re at a very weird cultural movement. A lot of people are just fundamentally unsure and I think, to a certain extent, hearing more good news may just make people angrier.Subscribe to our newsletter so you don't miss the rest of the Verge 2021 interviews.

Thereâ€™s the part where thereâ€™s rapid technological change and very rapid productivity improvement. In that part of the economy, you would include things like media â€” podcasts versus radio is a great example of rapid technological change. Streaming versus broadcast TV and so forth. Retail is obviously going through massive productivity improvements and changes. Manufacturing â€” the price of televisions has dramatically collapsed in the last 10 years, and the TV [you can buy] now for 400 bucks is like science fiction compared to what you could get 10 years ago. Cars are going through rapid productivity changes now. Youâ€™ve got these sectors that have gone through these massive productivity changes. They are characterized by rapidly improving quality, but also collapsing prices and rapid productivity growth. â€œThere are two very different parts of the economy.â€� Youâ€™ve got this other, second part of the economy thatâ€™s the exact opposite â€” where quality is not improving and prices are rising. There you talk about health care, where it feels like every year you pay 10 or 15 percent more and you get some new stuff, but you donâ€™t get a lot of new stuff for the money. You talk about education, where the rising cost of a modern college education is just staggering. Actually, itâ€™s funny â€” all forms of media are collapsing in price, other than textbooks. Textbooks are rising in price exactly the same as college tuition, which is a good illustration of the difference between the two sectors. Construction, real estate â€” thereâ€™s been a lot of conversation recently about how weâ€™re still fundamentally wedded to physical location way more than you would think at this point with the internet and everything else.          In the industries where thereâ€™s rapid productivity growth, everybody is freaked out, because what are people going to do after everything gets automated? In the other part of the economy, that second part, health care and education, people are freaked out about, ""Oh my God, itâ€™s going to eat the entire budget! Itâ€™s going to eat my personal budget. Health care and education is going to be every dollar I make as income, and itâ€™s going to eat the national budget and drive the United States bankrupt!"" And everybody in the economy is going to become either a nurse or teacher. Itâ€™s really funny, both sides of the economy get polar opposite emotional reactions.          I go through all of that to say that the tech industry has been able to build startups and new technologies against that first category but not that second category. Tech is super present in retail in the form of e-commerce, weâ€™re super present in media in the form of internet, weâ€™re super present in consumer electronics in the smartphone. We are very much not present, in what we would consider to be a healthy way, in education, health care, construction, childcare, senior care. The great twist on that is that second category â€” thatâ€™s most of the GDP. Most of the spending is most of the GDP, and these are the areas where we have not yet been able to crack the code.      â€œHow audacious or insane is it to think that you could bring tech to health care or education?â€�     The big thing happening in the valley right now is valley entrepreneurs are getting much more aggressive at starting tech companies in that second category. We are seeing a lot more startups going into, especially, health care, biotech, different applications on that side. Weâ€™re seeing a lot of startups going into education. Weâ€™re not so much seeing startups going into construction, but weâ€™re seeing lots of startups going into the collaborative work: Slack and GitHub and telepresence and Skype and all of these things, that in theory, in the long run, will make geography less relevant and maybe solve the cost of housing and access to economic opportunity.Financial services has had rising costs, not falling costs, which it really shouldnâ€™t have â€” weâ€™re seeing a lot of fintech startups going into that. Itâ€™s this reorientation, and the valley is still doing all of the first category things, but it feels like weâ€™re now layering on a lot of the second categories.Thatâ€™s very exciting, in that we can have the impact in the second category like we had in the first category, which I think would be good. Of course, the other possibility is this is just pure hubris, and five years from now youâ€™re going to play this back and youâ€™ll be like, ""Aha! Dot-com bubble 2.0. He was full of it and he didnâ€™t realize it. The entire thing came crashing down."" How audacious or insane is it to think that you could bring tech to health care or education? Itâ€™s probably 50/50.            Whatâ€™s the state of robotics, particularly robots you might use around the house?It depends on what you mean by robot. One definition of robot is every thermostat is a robot now. Thermostats used to be literally an analog thing. Now theyâ€™re digital â€” theyâ€™re computers. Itâ€™s happening quite quickly.The other thing I think people miss is, you look at a lot of these companies and you say, ""This company makes self-driving cars. This company makes VR headsets. This company makes tabletop robot toys. This company makes drones."" And they all look like theyâ€™re separate categories of things, and they are they do different things. But the grand unifying principle underneath is that theyâ€™re actually new computer companies.  ""Where are all the other computer companies?"" It has felt, in the industry, for the last 15 or 20 years, like there was no new opportunity to make a new computer company. Itâ€™s like, ""Where are all the other computer companies?"" The answer is that they are all of these new categories. The drone companies are new computer companies, the self-driving car companies are new computer companies, and itâ€™s hardware plus software. Whatâ€™s interesting is there are probably more new computer companies in the valley today than there were probably since 1982 â€” itâ€™s just that the products are all these different shapes, sizes, and descriptions. Itâ€™s not a laptop, itâ€™s a flying machine that does stuff.                                         I will always take a flying machine.Exactly â€” pretty cool! We know of three top-end flying car startups in the valley, two of which Larry Page is funding himself. We havenâ€™t funded one yet, but weâ€™re starting to get the pitches. I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™ll get them to work.I didnâ€™t even think to ask you about flying cars. Are the pitches that youâ€™re getting on flying cars improving?Thereâ€™s a couple of big challenges in flying cars. [For safety reasons] I donâ€™t want human beings driving flying cars. In fact, autonomous air is easier than autonomous ground â€” because you have more degrees of freedom to get out of trouble. ""How do we get the thing airborne and 50 miles without literally running out of charge?"" The big constraint on all of this stuff is batteries. Assuming no battery breakthrough, what [flying car] companies are trying to solve, fundamentally, is the power problem â€” which is, ""How do we get the thing airborne and 50 miles without literally running out of charge?""The single biggest X factor in the next five or 10 years for all of this stuff will be if there is some fundamental breakthrough in battery technology, then basically all of these questions of whatâ€™s possible get reopened. Because if I had 10 or 100 times the amount of power that lasts 10 or 100 times longer, then weâ€™re building Iron Man suits. Then all kinds of things start to happen.That breakthrough could happen at any point. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s necessarily a Silicon Valley startup that does that. I think thatâ€™s either a research university or probably a big industrial research lab â€” Honeywell, GE, Toshiba, or one of these companies. There is tons of R&ampampD going into that right now, because itâ€™s such an obvious problem. Any time that breakthrough happens, thatâ€™s the big one â€” and then all of the sudden, we really do have flying cars.You mentioned autonomous vehicles. Lyft, another one of your portfolio companies, recently said the majority of its rides would be given in autonomous vehicles within five years. What do you expect the rollout of those vehicles is going to look like? And whatâ€™s the hold up?This is the big reason why the Googleâ€™s self-driving car isnâ€™t out yet. Itâ€™s a really hard challenge: youâ€™re driving through the neighborhood and youâ€™re going 40 miles an hour, and you turn left into an area thatâ€™s going 25 miles an hour, and thereâ€™s a crosswalk, and thereâ€™s a school, and thereâ€™s kids running around. Thatâ€™s hard, and you canâ€™t screw it up, and there are serious consequences to errors.There are lots and lots of edge cases, because roads move. What happens when thereâ€™s construction? Youâ€™ve got the guys with the stop and the slow sign and the flags. Whatâ€™s the computer supposed to do? Think of how advanced the computer has to be to understand that as compared to understanding just a stop sign. And they have to be able to deal with that because those things pop up in random places all the time.What that basically says is itâ€™s unlikely that there will be a mass rollout of self-driving cars all at once for all traffic scenarios. Therefore, [itâ€™s] unlikely that there will be an instant, freeze-dried overnight Uber or Lyft competitor that is just self-driving cars. ""If you saw Sully with the geese in the engine, you still want somebody with judgment sitting there making the call."" Think about a city with suburbs. Some percentage of the trip requests you could satisfy with a self-driving car. But to start with, that will be a small percentage of the total trips. A much larger percentage of the trips will still require a human driver. Maybe a human driver for the next two years, and then maybe a human monitor in the car, ready to take over when the computer punks out.Thatâ€™s the other thing â€” you get the so-called Level 3 autonomy, which is basically like the way airplanes work today. Yeah, youâ€™ve got the autopilot. Yeah, the thing can fly itself, it can even take off and land itself, but youâ€™ve still got the pilot sitting there in the seat, awake and paying attention, and itâ€™s a big problem if you donâ€™t because, if you saw Sully with the geese in the engine, you still want somebody with judgment sitting there making the call.I think most of those people in this agree with this: the deployment model is not going to be an either / or deployment model, itâ€™s going to be a matrix or a hybrid thing. This is to say, you can see where it is today, you can see where it ultimately ends up, and everything in the middle is complex and will take time. Thatâ€™s why we think Lyft and Uber and others are going to be central to this.I think most people think self-driving cars are more likely to get deployed as a service than as a product. Itâ€™s easier to deploy them as a service, because you can just put them in the street and let them start giving people rides, as opposed to trying to convince somebody to buy a self-driving car. Especially if theyâ€™re more expensive to start because of the sensor packages.How do you expect these kinds of services to affect cities?There are mayors that would, for example, like to just declare their city core to [ban] human-driven cars. They want a grid of autonomous cars, golf carts, buses, trams, whatever, and itâ€™s just a service, all electric, all autonomous.Think about what they could do if they had that. They could take out all of the street parking. They could take out all of the parking lots. They could turn the entire downtown area into a park with these very lightweight electric vehicles. No pollution, no noise, no nothing. It would be almost like going to an airport, where you could drive and then you drop your car off and then a self-driving golf cart would take you into town. There are cities that want to do that, and not just in the US â€” there are cities internationally that want to do that, including in some countries where the government can order that to happen. College campuses, retirement communities, amusement parks, industrial campuses, and large office complexes in some cases are places where this stuff can get rolled out in a top-down way. I think youâ€™ll see a hopscotching kind of thing, as opposed to sudden mass adoption.Letâ€™s say we do get to this fully autonomous vision of the world, and all the people who had long commutes suddenly have all of this free time. What sort of companies do you see emerging from a world where autonomous vehicles are the norm?This is the thing that I believe is completely missed in all of the fear and uncertainty that people have around this. Everybody is a professional pessimist in business these days, including a lot of the VCs. Itâ€™s like, ""Oh my God, the self-driving vehicles are going to displace 5.5 million professional driving jobs in the US over the next five years! Oh my God, the economic devastation! Itâ€™s going to be terrible for the economy."" But the other side of it is all the productivity improvements that come out the other side from people not having to literally sit there paying attention in the car. ""All of the sudden commutes become viable and, possibly, attractive."" The first order of productivity thing that happens is exactly what you said, which is that the entire amount of time spent in the car sitting there paying attention â€” or playing PokÃ©mon Go when youâ€™re supposed to be paying attention â€” all of that time frees up. All of the sudden commutes become viable and, possibly, attractive.At that point, the form factor of the vehicle changes, because at that point, the driver doesnâ€™t even need to face forward. There is no driver! You can have cars that are just rolling living rooms or bedrooms. You could literally just nap on your way to work. Or you could have an office. Or you could have entertainment pods â€” you could have VR. Or you can have a bus thatâ€™s a giant classroom and the kids can go on a field trip and the teacher could be up there teaching a class for two hours. All of that time, the productivity gained through that to the economy, and to all of us as individuals, is just gigantic.The long-run thing thatâ€™s going to happen here, I think, is very enticing. The really big economic impact of cars was not the car industry â€” the really big economic impact was suburbs and retail and package delivery and movie theaters and motel chains and theme parks and the interstate and truck stops and all the other implications. Basically, the entire way we live today is a consequence of the invention of the automobile. Because, before that, people just never went anywhere. Therefore, everything that you travel to is a consequence of the automobile.We talked about the role of cities earlier. One of the big issues with inequality, which is very vivid right now in the valley and in San Francisco, is can you literally afford to live someplace? Itâ€™s like this stupid Prop. 13 thing we have in California. If youâ€™re an old homeowner you pay no property taxes, if youâ€™re a new homeowner you get completely drilled. It presumably should be the other way around, but politically, it got corrupted and it got wired up the wrong way. Rents in San Francisco [have] doubled in the last five years, which is just complete lunacy. In Detroit, you can buy a house for $100. In the valley, itâ€™s hard to buy a house for less than $2 million. Itâ€™s just complete lunacy. Half of the people in Detroit should move to the valley and canâ€™t. Itâ€™s just nuts. ""I think telepresence, ultimately, is the answer."" Then itâ€™s like, ""Okay, smart guy: internet, the phone, video conferencing, telepresence, VR, AR, collaboration, Slack, GitHub, Asana, all of these things."" Seriously? The joke in the valley is, ""Help wanted. Programmer / designer wanted for state-of-the-art Silicon Valley telepresence software company making collaborative work easy across geography and time zone. Must be willing to relocate to San Francisco."" Itâ€™s just nuts.Stage one, I think, would get transportation to be something where if an hour in the car is actually pleasurable, itâ€™s one of the best parts of the day as opposed to one of the worst parts of your day. That would help a lot. Because then you could live south of San Jose and not kill yourself trying to commute to Redwood City. Thatâ€™s one. But the other would be go after telepresence. I think telepresence, ultimately, is the answer. Because you just have computer-mediated communication, which is just exactly like you and I are in the room together. The way I think about it is, thatâ€™s the one-two punch to solve all of this real estate-related nonsense. We canâ€™t technologically fix real estate, but we can make it less necessary.            You mentioned having the answer to this question, which you get a lot of criticism for, particularly on Twitter, about what happens to the 5.5 million jobs? What is your answer to that for how the economy gets remade?[Itâ€™s] a two-part answer. These are things that are true and nobody knows. The American economy this year will create 24.5 million gross new jobs, and it will destroy 21 million gross jobs. This is where the headlines are misleading. Theyâ€™re unintentionally misleading, but theyâ€™re misleading. When you read the job headlines itâ€™s like, ""The US economy created 300,000 jobs last month,"" and youâ€™re like, ""That seems like a really small number."" Itâ€™s always reported as the net. The gross is much larger than the net. ""The US economy is like the duck: it looks calm on the top and is paddling furiously underneath."" The first-order answer to the question is the US economy, just this quarter, will destroy over 5 million jobs normally. The US economy is like the duck: it looks calm on the top and is paddling furiously underneath. We will destroy and re-create over 5 million jobs just this quarter, and we will do it again in Q1 of â€˜17, and weâ€™ll do it again in Q2 of â€˜17, and weâ€™ll do it again in Q3 of â€˜17. Five and a half million jobs get reallocated over the next five years â€” it sounds like a lot, but itâ€™s a drop in the bucket compared to the overall level of change happening in the economy.The other part of the answer is dynamism. The rate of gross creation and destruction of jobs, economists call that dynamism. Would you believe that the rate of dynamism, which is to say the absolute size of growth creation and destruction of jobs in the US economy, has been rising continuously? Has the rate of change been rising continuously for the last 40 years or falling continuously?I would guess rising.Everybody thinks itâ€™s rising, and the answer is itâ€™s been falling. What the numbers show is the US economy is becoming less dynamic over time, not more dynamic. The same thing on startups. The rate of startup formation in the US has been declining for 40 years. Everybody thinks itâ€™s been rising itâ€™s been declining for 40 years.The economy tends to get stereotyped, especially in political seasons â€” everybody either works for a manufacturing company or flips burgers, and you get this wild, oversimplification of the economy. In reality, the economy as it exists today, is this incredibly complex, multidimensional, multifaceted thing with just huge oceans of people doing jobs that we probably have never even heard of, huge numbers of people in all of these different sectors of health care, and in-home care, and childcare, huge numbers of people in education, and infrastructure, and government jobs, and the military, and all of these different fields and professions. ""The rate of dynamism in Western Europe is a fourth of what it is in the US."" It turns out the rate of dynamism in Western Europe is a fourth of what it is in the US. Theyâ€™ve designed their economic system that way. They want change to happen slowly, itâ€™s why they have all of the laws and rules and work restrictions and unions and all of this stuff. It directly translates to their economy [being unable to] adapt, therefore high unemployment. If youâ€™re a capitalist, if youâ€™re like me, itâ€™s obvious that theyâ€™re going to have high youth unemployment coming out of that because theyâ€™ve wired their economy so that it canâ€™t adapt.Conversely, if you want to have opportunity for people to be very easily able to get work, and be able to very easily change work if they decide to go to a new field or they decide to go get a new level of skill or a new kind of college degree or if they decide they want to move to a new place, you want more change â€” because that creates more opportunity. To your point, the prevailing view is that must be bad, and itâ€™s just part of the national pessimism.It is interesting. Notwithstanding the fact that we do all of these things to screw up our own country, we are actually still good at this.            This year we saw a ton of VR and AR headsets come to the market. Does it seem inevitable to you that these will be fully mainstream technologies, or are we still waiting for the right combo of hardware and software to get there?Yes and yes.Any guesses on what will be the breakthrough moment for VR?In general, in venture capital and startups, the hardest thing to call is timing. The way it gets written after the fact is, ""It was obvious it was going to happen at point X, and the people who thought it would happen earlier were stupid."" When youâ€™re in the middle of it, itâ€™s actually not that obvious. I always like to point out Apple came out with the Newton in 1989, and boy, it seemed like it was the time. And it turned out it took another 20 years to get to the iPad.Maybe it happens now, maybe it doesnâ€™t. If it doesnâ€™t happen now, what weâ€™re trying to do is set up, at our firm, basically a willingness to make the same bet five years from now, and then if it still doesnâ€™t work, 10 years from now, and if it doesnâ€™t work, 15 years from now. Basically, just keep coming at it.Is there anything about your everyday life that you think actually is going to be radically different five years from now?One of the ideas that we play [around with] here at the firm, we call Harry Potter world. One of the things about Harry Potter is everything is moving around and alive. The photos are all going, ""Hey,"" and the plate goes and refills itself and brings you fresh food, and your beer mug tells you youâ€™re drinking too much. Everything is just smart. This is my view of the Internet of Things: youâ€™re able to infuse intelligence into everything, youâ€™re able to put a chip in everything, youâ€™re able to put software in everything, youâ€™re able to connect everything online, and just everything is a lot smarter. The doorknob is a lot smarter, and the lightbulb is a lot smarter, and your wristwatch is a lot smarter. Everything starts to get really, really smart. ""I think 2020 is probably going to be a worse version of this election."" The other thing is this geography topic. If anything, the geography problem becomes more intense five years from now. The price of cities relative to the price of not being in cities continues to grow. I think thatâ€™s going to be a major political stress. I actually think that explains a lot of whatâ€™s happening in this election. I think 2020 is probably going to be a worse version of this election.How so?With even worse candidates. I think it gets worse. Itâ€™s not even so much have or have-not in terms of wealth or income, itâ€™s have or have-not in terms of opportunity. And if Iâ€™m in rural Wisconsin or rural Ohio or something, and Iâ€™m in a coal mining town or a steel town where thereâ€™s just not going to be another steel mill, that is a very stressful way to be. ""Boy, I would love to move to San Francisco, but I physically canâ€™t because I canâ€™t afford it."" Thatâ€™s tough. That, to me, explains a lot of whatâ€™s happening in politics right now and in economics. I think that gets more intense.However, it is also true that your kid in the village in Indonesia, or the kid of the steelworker in Cleveland, they are going to have access to more and more opportunity. Whether itâ€™s being able to do remote programming work, or remote design work, or different kinds of educational alternatives.I think thereâ€™s going to be more economic opportunity opening up in five years â€” more ways for people to be able to provide services online, or be able to sell products online, or be able to find jobs online, or be able to get skills online. I think we really start to move that out in five years. Itâ€™ll be the steady drumbeat of empowerment and opportunity coming underneath what looks like a very stressed, very angry time.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",2016.0,11.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

",2016-11-17,"      The Verge 2021In celebration of our 5th anniversary, this month weâ€™re publishing a series of interviews with innovative leaders about what the next five years hold. To read more about this series, read our editor Nilay Patelâ€™s introduction here.Aaron Levie spends more time thinking about the future of work than most. When the 30-year-old entrepreneur co-founded Box, it was as a place for average people to store their files online â€” Dropbox before there was Dropbox. But years ahead of Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, Levie saw that the real money in online storage was in the workplace â€” and so the company turned to making products that let people collaborate at work.The result is a company that successfully went public and beat Wall Streetâ€™s expectations in its last earnings report, though it still has yet to turn a profit. (Levie says it will be cash-flow positive by the end of the year.)When Levie is away from Box, heâ€™s surveying the tech landscape for other innovations. He has been a savvy investor, making early bets on companies including Stripe, Zenefits, Instacart, Authy, Robinhood, and Color Genomics. His work has given him an optimism about the way that new productivity tools will make working life better for the average cubicle dweller â€” making organizations more transparent, and good ideas easier to spread.Levie is also an evangelist for artificial intelligence, which is slowly but surely working its way into the office. The future of work is in many ways a story about the future of AI â€” about what it can predict, what it can prevent, and what it can do on your behalf.  The InterviewYour company exists, in part, because mobile devices enable us to demand consumer-quality experiences in our work software. Five years from now-ish, how close will we be to parity between work and consumer software? Will we even recognize a distinction ultimately between these two things?        I think you sort of nailed it, which is mobile and cloud sort of conspire to redefine what enterprise software looks like and how it runs and how it operates. I would say we are already on the cusp of that happening, where our enterprise technology should resemble and be as simple as our consumer technology. What we actually have is an issue where thereâ€™s just a disparity of the tools that the most early adopting types of companies are using and the tools that the rest of the world uses.        If you were to look at maybe how we work, weâ€™re probably already using mostly technology that feels like, and is indistinguishable from, consumer software. But if you go to large corporations all around the world, whether itâ€™s DOW Chemical, or Ford, or these big businesses around the planet, thereâ€™s a separation of the haves and have-nots of modern technology. I think five years from now, we will have converged. Companies wonâ€™t be implementing old technology anymore.Subscribe to our newsletter so you don't miss the rest of the Verge 2021 interviews. Terms apply.SubscribeHow will the tools themselves changes?I think whatâ€™s going to happen is enterprise software will become more and more deceptively simple. &ampnbspItâ€™ll feel like weâ€™re using just a consumer application. I think we would agree that a product like Slack, or what Facebook is doing with Facebook at Work â€” these just resemble consumer applications.          And how does that change organizations over time?If you study modern management science of just how organizations have been built up over the past 100 years, you have a very clear hierarchy. The hierarchy has been built up to empower the flow of information up and down the organization. We had to structure our organizations in a very specific way because we didnâ€™t have technology to help us communicate in real time with anybody, anywhere.   â€œThe best ideas donâ€™t necessarily free flow to the people making the decision.â€�  You have a lot of companies that are very hierarchical, where the way you get ahead is you hoard information, you hoard power. The best ideas donâ€™t necessarily free flow to the people making the decision. You get only a small subset of the ideas to work off of. Most organizations, the way theyâ€™re designed is not necessarily the right organizational structure with the right people at the top, because itâ€™s the people that have gotten ahead using a very specific set of tools that were built up in a non-digital era.Now, imagine an organization that can share [information] in real time with anybody, anywhere across the company. You essentially have a virtual space that flattens the organization, where now itâ€™s actually not just about the people that are able to obtain and retain the information, but the people that put forth the best ideas and can execute on those. I think youâ€™ll start to see that work just changes in a pretty material way, because itâ€™s not about how much information you have versus everybody else. Everybody has the same level of information. Now itâ€™s about who can execute on that information and who can continue to put forth better and better ideas.The speed at which our companies are going to run and operate is going to change pretty dramatically. The kinds of organizations that will win will be those that can adapt to this in the best way, and so far weâ€™ve seen that itâ€™s companies like the Ubers and the Facebooks of the world that are able to operate and work in this way. The legacy companies just cannot move and change fast enough to act on this.            Hearing all this, someone who works at a more traditional, siloed organizations, might think, wow, it sounds like work is going to take over my whole life, and I need to make total institutional awareness of every interaction inside my company. &ampnbspAll of these changes that youâ€™re describing, which do have many advantages in the organization â€” do they have real advantages for the employee?There are a lot of people around the world that actually want to do awesome things. They want to do their best work, but theyâ€™re not recognized by the organization. Their ideas donâ€™t bubble up to the top, because of the complex and archaic way that we built businesses. I think that some people will lose in this future â€” the people that got ahead hoarding information and working in a way that was very specific to that model of an organization. Youâ€™ll have a new era of people that are able to win on their ideas, and able to win on what maybe we would consider to be actually better reasons, that open up opportunity for a lot of people that previously their voices were not necessarily heard. â€œIâ€™m generally optimistic.â€�I did a couple internships before we started Box. It was just so obvious that due to the hierarchical structure of an organization, if you were 21 or 22 entering that company, itâ€™s going to take you 10 or 15 years for your ideas to be valued by anybody at the top of the organization. Thatâ€™s just how it was structured. Actually, nobody at the top of the organization wants you to get ahead, because the whole design of the system is that way you can have a clear hierarchy, people can keep their jobs, etc. We actually do want disruption to that structure. We want organizations to be able to get the best ideas so they can change more rapidly, so they can perform in the best way possible. Iâ€™m generally optimistic.For many people who do this kind of knowledge work, email has been the foundation of their day for decades. Will that still be the case five years from now?Email is to communication as newspapers are to media or news, which is to say that thereâ€™s going to be multiple channels over time. Email has been the dominant channel, but we now know there are other experiences, there are other paradigms that we want to be able to have with our communication. We want a real-time experience. Thatâ€™s where a Slack or a chat tool comes in. You canâ€™t fit real-time in email, and any time you try, it creates just a very complex Frankensteinian product that nobody really wants, like Google Wave or something.            Five years from now, do you think you will send fewer emails than you do today?I actually send not a large amount of emails, so I donâ€™t think I could send fewer emails. I think that I already am using different tools.How do you think advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning will reshape work over the next several years?We think about it in a bunch of ways. Most of the most interesting AI machine learning examples that weâ€™ve seen so far have been on the consumer side. All of this stuff serves to make our daily lives a little bit more convenient. It helps us engage with the people we want to connect with, tells us when thereâ€™s a birthday coming up. Thatâ€™s essentially what itâ€™s doing. Siri helps us interact with information in our device in so many ways.Weâ€™ve never actually seen real deep machine learning or narrow AI applied to business problems. Itâ€™s just never really happened at any meaningful scale. Thereâ€™s been some kind of pattern recognition and anomaly detection, but never really have we applied actual advanced intelligence and machine learning to business problems. â€œWhat happens when we take all these business applications and we start to apply real intelligence?â€� What happens when we take all these business applications and we start to apply real intelligence to them? That, to us, paints a very, very different picture of what could possibly happen in the workplace. Thereâ€™s a whole range of outcomes, but at the starting point you just think how much time we all collectively waste doing things that literally require no thought. When you can &ampnbsphave the computer do those things for you, now maybe weâ€™ve started to save 20, 30, 40 percent of the time that we have in a given day. Technology is helping us just focus on the things where we fundamentally have to interact with the tool or system, but the technology is doing the rest for us.All the way to the other end of the spectrum, which are things that people werenâ€™t doing in the first place. Now itâ€™s possible for the first time ever to have computers aid a person in a way that wasnâ€™t previously possible. Thatâ€™s where the power of AI in healthcare or life sciences or financial services starts becoming incredibly powerful â€” which is, how do you take the experiences that tens of millions of patients have had on a specific drug and apply that to just one individual patient that a doctor is interacting with? How can we take all of the data that we have and be able to apply it in a highly precise way that no individual could have previously done because they werenâ€™t able to process across all of that information?Itâ€™s going to be everything from saving time to completely changing business or human outcomes because of this technology. Sundar [Pichai] had a pretty good analogy of AI is the new mobile â€” which is to say software that isnâ€™t mobile today just feels out of date and clunky. Well, software in five years from now where youâ€™re having to do anything manual is going to feel out of date and clunky.â€œIf youâ€™re in sales, it should be telling you who to sell to.â€� The technology should be telling you what to do: if youâ€™re in sales, it should be telling you who to sell to. If youâ€™re in marketing, it should tell you who to market to. If you are in healthcare, it should give you suggestions of the potential prescription or the diagnosis that you should have. If you are in manufacturing, it should instantly collapse your supply chain so you know where the potential problems are going to be so you can go right after them.Iâ€™m probably more in the optimistic side of the spectrum. Thereâ€™s a lot of fear that it will disrupt jobs, but I think itâ€™ll probably more have an impact, at least for the foreseeable future, of raising of the level of work that weâ€™re all able to do because we just wonâ€™t waste our time doing the stuff that is entirely redundant to what a computer can do.            When it comes to the future of work, does it feel like weâ€™re on the verge of kind of a fresh wave of really generational companies that may have something to do with AI and machine learning?Iâ€™m probably more on the side that AI will have a much bigger impact on existing modern technologies than sort of an AI-first company emerging that does a bunch of these new things. I think there are some companies that are pure AI-first that are building powerful platforms that I think have a strong chance of being successful, but because you need a large amount of data and interaction already to be able to make use of that, the companies that should have a strong benefit or advantage should be companies like Slack and Box and Workday and Salesforce. Because they already have the usage, they already have the data, and now AI is just a turbocharger for what people can do.AI will be something where you will get disrupted if you donâ€™t have it, but I believe itâ€™s an enabling technology as opposed to a disruptive technology because itâ€™s intended to dramatically enhance our existing tools and services. Now, the one caveat I would say, just so I donâ€™t look stupid and not like somebody claiming that phones need keyboards or something, is if thereâ€™s a fundamental shift in where AI is in five or 10 years from now and it does things we simply canâ€™t even contemplate today, potentially you would want completely new types of experiences to be built off of that that existing incumbents couldnâ€™t adapt to for business model reasons or whatever. That would be what makes it disruptive.Five years from now, are there technological tools you hope you have that you donâ€™t have today?â€œVirtual reality will probably have more impact in the enterprise space than the consumer space.â€� I think virtual reality will probably have more impact in the enterprise space than it does in the consumer space at its mature peak, because I think the implications are so enormous that it at least has the makings of being one of the very, very fundamentally disruptive technologies.We sort of see VR as maybe being to the non-office worker as iPad was to the knowledge worker, which is the iPad was the first thing that was like, okay, I can kind of digitize my entire mobile experience around documents and email and communication. Thereâ€™s the perfect form factor for being able to go and do that. I think VR has the ability to bring that same level of immersive experience, but in a world where we havenâ€™t necessarily enabled people with best-in-class technology. Whether thatâ€™s manufacturing, when youâ€™re designing a product or you want to go look at the building that youâ€™re creating, or in education, or if youâ€™re in healthcare and you want to be able to instantly learn about or interact with multiple patients and different experiences.We always overestimate the change in two or three years and underestimate it in a decade. Itâ€™s probably in that type of category, which is things that we think about VR being useful for today are just based on us just imagining a very linear shift. Itâ€™s going to be more of a function change.            How will Trumpâ€™s election change the course of business â€” either yours or Silicon Valleyâ€™s in general? Are you making contingency plans you werenâ€™t before for the next four years?This election exposed serious divisions throughout the nation. At Box, weâ€™re committed to our values of openness and equality and will do everything to fight for them, including being an advocate for racial and gender equality, LGBTQ rights, fair immigration policies, and more. There are many policies weâ€™ll need to debate in tech, but equality should be a non-negotiable principle for America.â€œThis election showed that many communities have been left behind.â€� Second, this election showed that many communities have been left behind as weâ€™ve entered the 21st century. In Silicon Valley, we need to be more honest about the negative consequences technology can have for people â€” both in America and abroad. This isnâ€™t to say we shouldnâ€™t aggressively push forward with innovation. It simply means that we have to work better with each other, the government, and our communities to help the benefits of innovation be more broadly shared and advance policies that help people weather the disruptions technology can cause. This is only going get to get more important. Technology is on the verge of re-shaping industries like healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing, just to name a few.Finally, we all want America to remain a leader in innovation and the global economy. We have to recognize that itâ€™s not a given weâ€™ll end up ahead. Americaâ€™s role in the world of technology is unmistakable today, but maintaining our leadership is going to require making smart policy choices, cultivating partnerships between the public and private sectors, renewed investment in education, and fostering a culture of entrepreneurship. We canâ€™t take anything for granted.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",2016.0,11.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,
18,Sand's End,"
Josh Dzieza
",2016-11-17,"      Past the towers of downtown Miami and over Biscayne Bay sits the city of Miami Beach. Perched on the tip of a narrow barrier island, Miami Beach is a resort community of just under 100,000 people, though its population swells with a steady stream of tourists. Through the wall of hotels that line its shore is the city's central draw: the wide, white stretch of Miami Beach's beach. The beach is the centerpiece of the cityâ€™s promise of escape â€” escape from cold winters or college classes or family, where you can drink goblets of bright green liquor and cruise down Ocean Drive in a rented tangerine Lamborghini before retiring to the warm sand. To the casual observer, the beach may look like the only natural bit of the city, a fringe of shore reaching out from under the glass and pastel skyline. But this would be false: the beach is every bit as artificial as the towers and turquoise pools. For years the sea has been eating away at the shore, and the city has spent millions of dollars pumping up sand from the seafloor to replace it, only to have it wash away again. Every handful of sand on Miami Beach was placed there by someone.That sand is washing away ever faster. The sea around Miami is rising a third of an inch a year, and itâ€™s accelerating. The region is far from alone in its predicament, or in its response to an eroding coast: itâ€™s becoming hard to find a populated beach in the United States that doesnâ€™t require regular infusions of sand, says Rob Young, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University. Virginia Beach, North Carolinaâ€™s Outer Banks, New Yorkâ€™s Long Island, New Jerseyâ€™s Cape May, and countless other coastal cities are trapped in the same cycle, a cycle whose pace will become harder to maintain as the ocean rises.""There isnâ€™t a natural grain of sand on the beach in Northern New Jersey there is no Miami Beach unless we build it,"" Young says. ""The real endangered species on the coast of the US isnâ€™t the piping plover or the loggerhead sea turtle. Itâ€™s an unengineered beach.""The sea has been slowly cutting a divot into the shore in front of Miami Beachâ€™s iconic Fontainebleau hotel, encroaching nearly to the promenade. Patching it would normally be a small job. But Miami Beach has a problem, one more cities will soon face: it has run out of sand in the ocean nearby.            The beach is the tattered edge of the land. Itâ€™s made of debris, which we call sand when itâ€™s too small to think about discretely, though exactly what it consists of varies. It could be pulverized coral, like in the Maldives, or crushed clamshells, like Shark Bay, Australia, or discarded glass, like around Fort Bragg, California. Often itâ€™s rock that has been crushed by glaciers or eroded off mountains and washed down rivers to the sea. Beaches made from black basalt or purple garnet have a certain novelty value, but the ideal beach, the one you see on ads for airlines and beer, is sugary and white. Itâ€™s likely calcium carbonate or quartz.Coastal engineers talk about ""beach behavior,"" as if dealing with an unruly animal rather than a geologic feature. Waves sort sand grains to a depth where they no longer move them, so some beaches change with the seasons, as winter storms suck sand offshore, leaving only cobblestones, and smaller waves push it back in the summer. One thing all beaches have in common is that theyâ€™re always shifting, wave by wave over years or overnight, with a storm.For much of the 20th century, people tried to hold beaches in place by building groins â€” lines of rock or wood pylons protruding from the shore. But groins robbed downdrift beaches of sand that would have come their way, creating new erosion problems. (Some came to be called ""spite groins."") Seawalls made things worse, further blocking the natural movement of sand and forcing waves back onto the shore, scouring away the beach. By the 1970s, there was very little beach left on Miami Beach or shore at the Jersey Shore. So a new response became popular: add sand.            That job largely fell to the US Army Corps of Engineers. Dredges floated offshore, extending scoops or hoses tipped with cutter heads into the seafloor and piping sand back onto the eroding beach. Nourishment, as the practice is called, maintained the beach, but it was also an admission that there would never be a permanent solution to fixing the shore in place. Once you start nourishing a beach, you can never stop. Its equilibrium state lies elsewhere, and wave after wave will eat away at the shore, and youâ€™ll keep having to find new sand to replace it.Sand seems like an infinite resource, but it isnâ€™t. You canâ€™t put just any kind of sand on a beach. Forget about the thousands of miles of dunes in the Sahara and Gobi â€” rounded by wind, those grains are too smooth. Sand made by crushing rock is too jagged. Stones worn down by rivers and waves over millennia is ideal, but even then, it has to be the right type. If the grains are too small, they wash away quickly too large, and the beach becomes a steep bank. If theyâ€™re the wrong density or wrong shape â€” say, plate-like shards of broken shells â€” theyâ€™ll float in the water, causing clouds. If the sand is too dark it will trap heat, and can shift the gender of sea turtles born there. ""You want to match the native sand as close as you can,"" says Kevin Bodge, a coastal engineering consultant. ""That sand was there for a reason.""Once you start nourishing a beach, you can never stopTremendous amounts of ocean sand gets used for land reclamation and construction. Countries use it to extend their borders, like Singapore and China, which has built seven new islands in the South China Sea. Billions of tons of sand gets poured into concrete. A United Nations report on sand shortages found that up to 60 billion tons of sand and gravel are mined each year, more than twice the amount moved by all the rivers in the world, which the report notes makes ""humankind the largest of the planetâ€™s transforming agents with respect to aggregates.""The United States has lined its coasts with over a billion cubic yards of sand, at a cost of $8.6 billion, according to a database maintained by Andy Coburn at Western Carolina Universityâ€™s Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines. All that sand inevitably washes back into the sea. Sometimes waves bring it back, but for the most part, itâ€™s lost to us if itâ€™s sucked out past a certain depth, itâ€™s scattered along the continental shelf, too dispersed to be gathered back.With sea levels rising, demand for beach sand is only going to grow. About 57 percent of the coast in the lower 48 states is already eroding, according to the USGS. ""Every single coastal erosion problem we have right now is only going to get worse, not better,"" Young says. ""Itâ€™s only going to erode faster, not slower, require more sand, not less."" Gradually now, but soon overwhelmingly, every coastline is going to want to move inland. Young foresees a future of rising costs and conflict over diminishing sand. ""If you want to invest, buy a dredge.""No state requires more sand than Florida, which sits in the middle of hurricane alley and has the longest coastline after Alaska. Half of the 825 miles of beaches monitored by the stateâ€™s Department of Environmental Protection are designated as critically eroding, from Daytona Beach to the Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral to the shore in front of Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach estate of President-elect Donald Trump.            On July 31st, 2015, the Army Corps released a plan for patching eroding sections of Miami Beach. Miami-Dadeâ€™s sand resources had been exhausted, the Corps wrote, and some of the best alternatives lay to the north, offshore of Martin and St. Lucie counties. Though the shoals were in federal waters and the northern counties had no greater right to them than anyone else, they viewed the sand as theirs, and with the Corpsâ€™ announcement began the latest skirmish in what local officials call ""the sand wars.""State Senator Joe Negron, whose district includes parts of Martin and St. Lucie, swore that Miami-Dade ""wouldnâ€™t get a single grain."" Frannie Hutchinson, a St. Lucie commissioner, demanded the Corps ""take its shovels and buckets and go home."" She filed 15 public comments on the Corpsâ€™ proposal, saying that it failed to address sea level rise and would rob St. Lucie of needed sand. The county erosion chair for 14 years, Hutchinson says that she cringes every time she sweeps dirt out of her house. ""Do you know how much sand is in there? You canâ€™t replace sand.""There was a sense, in council meetings and public statements, that Miami Beach was reaping what it sowed, and that with the sea rising, it was every county for itself. ""Theyâ€™ve squandered their sand, theyâ€™ve overdeveloped, theyâ€™ve depleted their resources and now they want to come and take ours,"" says Sarah Heard, a Martin County Commissioner. ""We need to protect that offshore site, we need to guard it very carefully. We donâ€™t know exactly how sea level rise is going to impact us, but we know itâ€™s accelerating rapidly, we know thereâ€™s going to be inundation.""""Theyâ€™ve squandered their sand.""Heard is a Republican, but laments her partyâ€™s denial of climate change. (Last year, the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting found that the state's governor, Rick Scott, forbid state officials from using the term in emails or reports.) Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch, another Martin County commissioner who objected to the Corps plan, is also a Republican, and also clear-eyed about what rising seas will do to her community. Just as there are proverbially no atheists in foxholes, itâ€™s increasingly difficult to be a local politician in coastal Florida and deny the sea is rising.Yet what to do about it at a local level is a conundrum. Right now, the answer is to keep piling on more sand. Thurlow-Lippisch describes nourishment as a loop her town is trapped in: the most expensive property is on the beach, she says, and letting it fall into the sea would rob her county of 30 percent of its tax base, making it impossible to fund schools, run buses, and provide lunches for children in need. Though she wonders whether sheâ€™s doing the right thing, she continues to fight for the sand that her community will eventually have to put on its shore. ""We all have to look ourselves in the mirror and ask, is this a sustainable life? What are we doing here? But right now, weâ€™re in it, weâ€™re doing it.""As the northern counties lobbed angry missives at the Corps, one alternative kept coming up: the Bahamas.The nearest Bahamian islands are just 50 miles east of Miami. The sand grains there arenâ€™t rock, but orbs of calcium carbonate called aragonite, which some scientists believe is formed by bacteria as deep ocean water moves into the warm, shallow banks of the Caribbean. The exact process that produces the sand is poorly understood, says Lisa Robbins, an oceanographer who studies it, and occurs in only a few other places in the world, such as the Arabian Gulf.            One thing is clear: itâ€™s premium stuff. ""Theyâ€™re not only mysterious, theyâ€™re gorgeous, and wonderful to step on,"" Robbins says of the grains, which she likens to ""little pearls."" The sand is so white that when coastal engineer Kevin Bodge brought in a bargeâ€™s worth in the early â€˜90s for Fisher Island, a wealthy community willing to pay for it, the customs official looked on incredulously.""It was 1991,"" Bodge recalls, ""the height of the Miami Vice thing, so we had to clear customs, and it came in on a barge and when the sun hit that thing coming over the horizon in the early morning light, it was the most incredible pile of gleaming white powder Iâ€™ve ever seen. The customs agent just looked at me and said, â€˜You gotta be kidding me.â€™""The Bahamian government had been ambivalent about selling sand to nourish foreign beaches, says Anthony Myers, whose company holds a lease on a shoal near Bimini â€” why let tourists visit Bahamian sand beaches elsewhere? But in 2010, it relented. ""Iâ€™ve helped them understand the science,"" Myers says. ""If you donâ€™t sell this, youâ€™re just watching your money disappear into the chasms of the ocean.""""It was the most incredible pile of gleaming white powder Iâ€™ve ever seen.""Myers sells sand for plastics, agriculture, and other purposes, but to his great frustration, he has been unable to get his sand on Floridaâ€™s beaches. The federal government often pays half the cost of beach nourishment, with states and cities splitting the rest. But an amendment to the 1986 Water Resources Development Act prohibits federal funds from going toward foreign sand if domestic sources are available, which means anyone who wants Bahamian aragonite would have to pay the tab themselves.His consultant on the mainland, Jayson Meyers (no relation), shares his frustration. Sitting in a concrete and glass tower in downtown Miami, Meyers pulled out a plastic vial of Bahamian sand from his leather briefcase and placed it on the table. It was white as chalk. Heâ€™s shown it to mayors and councilmembers and any number of officials, and he says everyone wants some, but until they can get federal assistance, or decide to pay for it themselves, thereâ€™s nothing to be done. ""Itâ€™s great that they want it,"" he said, laughing bitterly. ""It doesnâ€™t do shit for getting it on the beach.""That may change eventually: in September the House passed an amendment proposed by Florida Representative Lois Frankel that would allow federal funds to go toward foreign sand, and Miami Beach is planning a small test project next year. But in the meantime, spurned by its neighbors and unable to buy sand abroad, Miami Beach turned inland, to a mine a hundred miles north. The sand from the northern counties was too dark and full of shells anyway, says an official with the county.""Theyâ€™ll be back,"" says Heard, the Martin County commissioner. ""And theyâ€™ll receive spirited opposition next time they try it.""            The mine is called Witherspoon and sits amid flat fields of pasture and scrub near the southwest shore of Lake Okeechobee. The water table is so high there that you strike it as soon as you dig, so in effect the mine is a pond, with a gray dredge floating in the middle sucking up sand from the bottom. On that late September day, the pond was still, mirroring the bright blue sky and high clouds, masking its 200-foot depth. The workers call it simply ""the pit.""In a shed on the pitâ€™s shore, Jacob Dampier scooped a small mound of sand onto a metal plate. With a spackling blade, deft and intent, sweating in the staggering heat, he cut it into four equal segments, squared their sides, leveled the top, and quartered them again. One brick he slid onto a scale, weighing out 350 grams, and slipped it into a ziploc bag. He pulled out a booklet, Munsellâ€™s Soil Color, basically the Pantone chart for dirt, and found a match: value seven, chroma one, eggshell white.""Sometimes itâ€™s a little gray, sometimes it has an orange tint,"" Dampier said. ""It depends where you are in the pit. But if itâ€™s white, they love it. And you see how white that is? Itâ€™ll blind ya.""For 27 years Dampier has tested sand of an astonishing range and specificity: chunky sand for asphalt, finer sand for concrete, finest for masonry and glass. Thereâ€™s a strict standard for volleyball courts, approved by an expert in Ontario, Canada, and a whole menu for golf courses: one blend for bunkers another for topdressing another, dyed green, for divot repair.                                    Since June, the mine had been running day and night producing sand for Miami Beach. White drifts lay beneath the tower where a machine sorts slurry from the dredge to fit exacting recipes of grain size. Tall hourglass cones lined the pit, and a dune stretched along the road where trucks sat idling, waiting to be waved out by a man standing under a rainbow beach umbrella. From here, three hundred trucks would drive 7,000 tons of sand to the parking lot of the Fontainebleau that day, and do it again the next, until over 300,000 tons have been placed on the shore.In all, itâ€™s projected to cost just under $12 million to patch 3,000 feet of Miami Beachâ€™s waterfront. Sand prices have risen sharply since 2006, to an average of about $20 a cubic yard, according to Coburnâ€™s database. Mined sand, sorted to bespoke criteria and requiring convoys of trucks, is more expensive still. Laurel Reichold, the Corps engineer managing the project, says at $60 a cubic yard, it costs twice what dredged sand would have.Yellow all-terrain trucks complete the final leg of the journey, ferrying sand from the parking lot to the beach, escorted by men on ATVs wearing goggles and bandanas pulled over their faces. They turn onto a peninsula of fresh beach jutting out from the eroded shore and dump the sand into the sea. Bulldozers follow, grading the sand down to a gentle slope. The new beach, uniform and flat, is disorienting to be on, without markers for perspective or scale. But once the trucks leave and the waves get to work, it will seem as natural as the rest of the shore, covered in sunbathers and umbrellas.""Itâ€™s gorgeous,"" said Elizabeth Wheaton, the cityâ€™s environment and sustainability director, picking up a handful of sand and letting it run through her fingers. ""You just want to make snow angels in it.""            Miami Beach has already begun to flood at high tide, and saltwater is pushing into the regionâ€™s aquifer. The city, like all South Florida, is doomed, says Hal Wanless, chair of the geological sciences department at the University of Miami. The stateâ€™s bedrock of porous limestone means that walls wonâ€™t stop the water itâ€™ll just seep up from below.Evidence of just how radically changes in sea level can reshape Floridaâ€™s coast is everywhere, written in the sand. One of the sand deposits the Corps was eyeing offshore of Martin County was a beach about 10,000 years ago, when the sea was 60 feet lower. The Witherspoon mine was a beach 130,000 years ago, when the sea was 20 feet higher. A recent study of Antarctic ice melt predicted that if carbon emissions arenâ€™t curtailed, by the end of the century the sea could rise by just over six feet, the high end of NOAAâ€™s forecast, and the average elevation of Miami-Dade County. In 500 years it could rise as high as 49 feet. Well before then, the Witherspoon mine would become a beach once again.The city, like all South Florida, is doomed.The inertia of the climate system means that even if carbon emissions were halted tomorrow, the sea would continue to rise for centuries. With a Republican Party in denial about climate change, and a president-elect who once called it a hoax perpetrated by China, we will likely lock in higher and faster rates of rise in the years to come. For cities on the coast it will be a slow catastrophe, involving myriad difficult decisions: whether to build infrastructure in an attempt to keep the water out, or whether to retreat from the coast, and if so, how to retreat without upending lives, economies, communities. One of the first decisions cities will face, one theyâ€™re already facing, is what to do about a shore thatâ€™s falling into the sea.It will probably always be worth it for Miami Beach to go to absurd lengths in order to maintain its shore, right up until the moment the city sinks beneath the sea. Mayor Philip Levine, one of the first Florida politicians to raise the alarm about climate change, has spent $100 million building pumps and raising roads and plans to spend hundreds of millions more. But Florida has no income tax, so if cities are going to pay for the infrastructure needed to adapt, property values need to keep rising and tourists need to keep coming. Without a beach, why come to Miami Beach?""The irony is, in Miami Beach and South Florida, the way to deal with rising sea levels is to build more condos,"" says Peter Zalewski, who tracks development through his site Condo Vultures. Just under 30,000 new units are planned or currently being built in Miami-Dade County, a region that already has more assets vulnerable to rising seas than anywhere in the world after Guangzhou, China. As long as Florida is trying to build its way out of climate change, the beach will need to be maintained, as a lure and a defense.""You can have buildings or you can have beaches, but you canâ€™t have both.""It wonâ€™t be worth it for other cities, however, especially if the federal government stops helping cover the cost of nourishment. The Army Corpsâ€™ mandate, Reichold says, is to protect property on the coast, and while recreation revenue is factored into the Corpsâ€™ cost-benefit analysis, that wouldnâ€™t preclude building seawalls instead of nourishment if sand gets too expensive. Cities will face a choice: retreat, or build walls to keep the water out, destroying the beach.""You can have buildings or you can have beaches, but you canâ€™t have both,"" says Orrin Pilkey, founder of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines. He thinks buildings will win that calculation, and there will be a rush to build seawalls. It happened on a small scale after Hurricane Sandy, as billionaires erected metal plates and piled up boulders to defend their Hamptons mansions. As the water rises, more and more of the coast will become armored, the sand will wash away, and the shoreline will resemble a fortress of concrete and rock.The beaches that remain would be amusement parks maintained at great expense, in cities like Miami Beach, Myrtle Beach, or Virginia Beach, perpetually rebuilt with sand from farther and farther out on the continental shelf, or inland from a once and future coast.            In late October, geologists from five East Coast states gathered at a lab in Palisades, New York, on the cliffs of the Hudson River. They were there to mark the opening of what is essentially a library of sand. For the two previous summers, a ship, the MS Thunderforce, had sailed from Miami to Boston, taking samples of the ocean floor, and now those samples had arrived at Columbiaâ€™s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.The survey was commissioned by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which handles resources in federal waters, farther than most states have traditionally gone for sand. But as states have begun to run low on sand nearby, theyâ€™ve started turning to BOEM for help, says Jeff Reidenauer, the bureauâ€™s marine minerals branch chief. With rising seas and stronger storms, itâ€™s only a matter of time before states along the Eastern Seaboard are scrambling for sand to repair their shores, and the bureau wanted to know where to go. The survey began in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and goes by the apt acronym of ASAP, for Atlantic Sand Assessment Project.In the lab, long tubes of sediment taken from the ocean floor lay displayed on tables. Researchers use the cores as time capsules, testing the stripes of clay and sand laid down over thousands of years to figure out what the planet was doing at the time. The people gathered in the lab that day, however, were mostly interested in the sand itself: its grain size, mineral type, how much of it there was and where.The cores from the Thunderforce filled rack after rack inside a refrigerated warehouse adjoining the lab. Each plastic case was labeled by state, almost a wall for each: Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida â€” 160 cores in all, with hundreds more on the way.The shore crumbled as Matthew passedThe library was opening just in time. Three weeks before, a low-pressure disturbance that began off the coast of Africa reached the Caribbean, strengthened unusually rapidly, and slammed into Haiti as Hurricane Matthew, Category 4. It was headed for a direct hit on Southeast Florida but bent to the east, skimming the coast, and flooding North Carolina.The storm sent powerful waves into the coast as it passed, washing away large sections of the shore in Georgia and South Carolina. In Florida waves washed over more than 50 miles of dunes. Beaches in St. Lucie County retreated dozens of feet, turning into cliffs. Brevard County had to rush sand onto the beach to protect homes left teetering over the sea. Jacksonville, in the middle of putting over 900,000 tons of sand on its beach, saw just as much wash away overnight. Near St. Augustine, waves punched through a dune and created a new inlet joining the Matanzas River with the Atlantic, while to the south, waves washed away dunes and concrete armor and chewed through a mile and a half of Highway A1A. Senator Bill Nelson promised the highway would be rebuilt and a new beach installed to protect it.The damage is still being assessed, and where the sand to replace it will come from is unclear. Maybe it will be brought from a prehistoric beach by convoys of trucks, or from a Bahamian shoal, or maybe the counties will fall into another sand war. Or maybe it will come from one of the new deposits deep out on the continental shelf, mapped, catalogued, and archived in a walk-in refrigerator on the Hudson river.Back at Miami Beach, work has paused for the winter. Sections of the new shore crumbled as Matthew passed but were soon repaired. Art Basel begins in a few weeks, and the completed beach in front of the Fontainebleau is ready to receive the dealers and collectors and partiers who will soon descend. Work will resume in the spring, with hundreds of trucks ferrying sand from the middle of the state to the shore, patching holes in a beach to postpone the day when it will inevitably vanish.Editor: Michael Zelenko and Elizabeth Lopatto",2016.0,11.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

In its 34 years, the creative process at EA has expanded from a handful of coders producing games in a couple of months, to hundreds of designers, artists, writers, and actors collaborating for years on global-facing blockbusters. But the past few years have been something of a unique inflection point. Wilson took the executive role at EA in 2013, the year the video game publisher won The Consumeristâ€™s ignominious title of Worst Company in America â€” for the second time in a row. Under his leadership the company has shifted focus to what it calls â€œplayer-first,â€� creating an internal committee to learn what fans said and continue to say across the internet, and to grow from that criticism. 2016 saw a return to form of EAâ€™s established sports franchises, a pair of critically acclaimed first-person shooters, a suite of successful smartphone games, and a high-profile flirtation with VR. All of which is to say, in the world of big-budget game development, Andrew Wilson seems to understand what works now. But Wilson is looking forward: his ambitions involve a bigger, broader, and more inclusive future. Thatâ€™s why we chose to chat with him about the video games â€” and interactive media â€” of tomorrow. The InterviewWhat is a day in the life of someone who enjoys video games in 2021?The biggest shift I think weâ€™ll see is games moving from being a discrete experience to an indiscrete experience.When I was 15 years old â€” Iâ€™m kind of in my 40s now â€” if I wanted to listen to music, I had a couple of choices. I could sit up all night and hope theyâ€™d play what I liked on the radio, or I could go down to the record store. I could buy a cassette tape of Bon Jovi or Poison or Guns and Roses or whatever it was I was listening to, go home, put it in my boom box, and sit down and listen. I really had to make a conscious decision. Even that was an evolution from where weâ€™d been 50 years before, where if I wanted to listen to music, I actually had to go and listen to an orchestra. Iâ€™d get dressed up in my tuxedo, and Iâ€™d go down and listen to music.Today, by virtue of the fact that almost every device I own plays me music, and services like Spotify curate and cultivate and personalize that music for me, music permeates almost every aspect of my life. Itâ€™s moved from being something I have to make a conscious decision to engage with, to something that really surrounds every aspect of my life from the minute I get up in the morning to the minute I go to bed at night.Subscribe to our newsletter so you don't miss the rest of the Verge 2021 interviews.

Itâ€™s not just a console business, or a PC business, or even a mobile business. Weâ€™ve now got virtual reality and augmented reality and streaming, too. Now fast-forward that to the future, and you think about what the world looks like with a 5G network streaming latency-free gaming to every device you own. Itâ€™s really easy to imagine that games would permeate our lives much the way digital music does today.From the minute I get up in the morning, everything I do has an impact on my gaming life, both discrete and indiscrete. The amount of eggs I have in my internet-enabled fridge might mean my Sims are better off in my game. That length of distance I drive in my Tesla on the way to work might mean that I get more juice in Need for Speed. If I go to soccer practice in the afternoon, by virtue of internet-enabled soccer boots, that might give me juice or new cards in my FIFA product. This world where games and life start to blend I think really comes into play in the not-too-distant future, and almost certainly by 2021.                      In 2021, what will I see on the shelf when I go into a store or on the front page of a digital storefront?I think weâ€™re going to start to see games take on a really different proposition. One of the core reasons why we engage with games is for social interaction. Maslowâ€™s hierarchy of needs: once you get past air, food, water, shelter, you get to sense of belonging, which is really about socially interacting. You get to self-esteem, which is really about overcoming challenges, and you get to self-actualization, which is really about creating in a living world. Games are going to give you all of those things. I think what we start to see is less about [what the game is] â€” is it a shooter, is it a sports game, is it open world or closed world, is it a linear story or a forked story, is it multiplayer â€” and more about this one, existing world where we all play a part.       â€œOne of the core reasons why we engage with games is for social interaction.â€�   I think that entertainment will continue to be a really important part of our lives. Weâ€™ll have moved from paintings on a cave wall and throwing bones into a circle to a global community interacting through games in a way thatâ€™s truly positive and fulfills social connection and competition and creation and self-esteem and overcoming challenges. I think itâ€™s going to be a really, really positive part of our lives.What youâ€™re describing sounds humongous, both as a virtual space and as a creative undertaking. How big are these virtual worlds? And how many people will it take to create them?         Whatâ€™s really interesting is when I started making games, which was [in] 2000, a big game team was about 20 people. When I took on FIFA in 2005, 2006, we had about 200 people. Now, I hear stories elsewhere in the industry of game teams that have a thousand people. The size of the worlds that are created are really directly proportionate to the amount of people on a team, and the amount of time they have to build. Itâ€™s really architecture. Itâ€™s building like any build is in the real world.         Think about a world where we arenâ€™t limited by the core team. Think about a world where we as game developers build kind of a foundational tool set and unleash 6 billion people on the planet to create whatever they think is amazing and what they believe will engage their friends, more than anything we could ever do.The world that we will create will be infinitely bigger than the Earth that we live on, and likely bigger than the Solar System that we live in.             Are you referring to something like Minecraft that will allow players to create from within a game, or are you speaking about billions of people actually coding video games?When I was a kid, I learned German at school. My school was really progressive, so we ultimately taught kids Mandarin. I grew up in Australia, so weâ€™re part of Asia. China was a big trade partner with Australia. Progression got us to Mandarin. Now I have a four-and-a-half-year-old daughter. My hope is that she learns computer code, because I truly believe that will be the universal language. â€œFast-forward 15 years into a world where... we all speak the universal language of code.â€� Fast-forward 15 years into a world where we might speak French or German or Chinese or Japanese, but we all speak the universal language of code. Think about what that means in the context of creating entertainment inside of a virtual world. Itâ€™s profound.This concept of a game following you through your day-to-day life is fascinating, but there are so many hurdles. Will we truly see the same game on each platform, or will the experience be unique depending on the hardware?As you think about us putting the entire experience into the cloud, what then happens is the nature of the experience isnâ€™t governed by the platform that you choose to play on. The nature of the experience is governed purely by the screen size that you have access to, and the connected controller, and the amount of time you have to play.When youâ€™re playing on a PlayStation 5 or 6 or whatever is available at that point, itâ€™s going to look one way on your big-screen TV. When youâ€™re looking at it through a mobile device, itâ€™s going to look a different way. When youâ€™re playing it on your internet-enabled fridge screen while youâ€™re getting the eggs out in the morning, because youâ€™re just doing a few quick trades for Madden Ultimate team, itâ€™s going to take a different format.The most important thing is that none of that time is wasted. Itâ€™s not throwaway time. Everything accumulates to the value of who you are in that virtual world. Thatâ€™s really our vision: to get to a point where we [donâ€™t] discern for you where you should play or how you should play, only that every minute of play that you invest in the experiences that we create adds value to who you are in that virtual world. Youâ€™re not throwing things away from one device to another or one experience to another.That goes from device to device. It also goes from game to game, because again, we as human beings are the sum total of our experience. Thatâ€™s what makes us who we are. Thatâ€™s what gives us our character. We want to replicate that in the virtual space.             But how do you produce those games across all of those platforms?What weâ€™re trying to do is prepare the company for a world where truly there are more devices capable of playing games, and players are refreshing them more often and likely refreshing them asynchronously. You might refresh your mobile device at a different time than I do. You might buy the 8K, I might stick with a 4K. You might go down the Oculus VR route, I might go down the PSVR route. What Iâ€™ve got to do as a creator is try and keep you together with your friends inside experiences that you love, and the only way we can do that is at a core engine level. â€œWhat Iâ€™ve got to do as a creator is try and keep you together with your friends inside experiences that you love.â€� We talk a lot about our single engine in Frostbite. It will scale up graphics on a bigger device and scale them down on a smaller device, so that we can build once and publish to many devices. Itâ€™s a world where weâ€™re no longer having to make a decision like, ""Do we build for the Xbox or the PlayStation or both?"" Thereâ€™s literally 30 or 40 or 50 different devices, and we have to be able to build for all devices that are meaningful for players.Weâ€™ve been investing heavily on that front for the last four or five years. And we think now, by virtue of that transition, we get more games on the PS4 and Xbox One than any other publisher. You see us now starting to really grow our mobile install base. You see us get to the PSVR and Google VR in the same time frame. Thatâ€™s the only path forward for us. In a world in which we have to build incrementally for every device, forget the cost implications of that, we literally just couldnâ€™t do it from a person power point of view.Representation is an ongoing issue with video games. For decades, weâ€™ve had this generic protagonist: the joyless, bald, muscular white guy. It feels as if indie creators rapidly expanded beyond that hero, and AAA is gradually following suit. What is being done to improve representation in big-budget games going forward?Representation is really important. Again, when I started playing games, we could squint and see 200 million players. Many of those players were 14-year-old boys playing in their motherâ€™s basements. That was really what gamers were. There was this negative connotation about what being a gamer meant. Today the average age of a gamer, I think, is about 35. Nearly 50 percent of them are female, and certainly gaming transcends all forms of culture and gender and background, both socioeconomic and ethnic background.As we think about representation inside games, what is the most important thing for us, like it is in movies and books and TV and all other forms of entertainment, is to really capture the true nature of the community thatâ€™s engaging in that content. When you look at some of our games today, you see that we have strong female leads, we have strong black leads, we have strong Latino leads, we have young leads to older leads. Itâ€™s really important as we design games, and that wasnâ€™t really any mandate that we made as a company, and it wonâ€™t be any mandate that we make going forward.Itâ€™s really just the creators inside of our organization saying, ""Hey, Iâ€™m looking at whoâ€™s playing our games. We know that they want to look into the games that we make and see people like them so that they can better relate to those games. We want to capture that.""The diversity that we live in today is amazing. Itâ€™s what is driving us as humanity forward is this real true understanding of who we are as a global community. We actually have probably more than any other community the ability to do that at the most profound level. We really want to capture that in our games.Letâ€™s talk about e-sports and competitive games. Are you concerned about the gap expanding between pro and amateur players â€” that newcomers will be too intimidated?I think e-sports looks like just about every other sport. Again, I spent the last 15, 16 years of my life working in sport. Thereâ€™s always the pinnacle of the sport. Thatâ€™s a really important part, and thatâ€™s aspirational for us. We watch a bunch of basketball, baseball, football, and soccer. â€œ Do we think the elite leagues are really important? Absolutely.â€� But the thing for me as a dad that is the single most important game that Iâ€™m ever going to watch will be my daughterâ€™s soccer game, because thatâ€™s the thing Iâ€™m most involved in. I love whatâ€™s happening in the Premier League, but that game that my daughter plays in is as important.Thatâ€™s our vision for what competitive gaming is. In all honesty, thatâ€™s how we think about the world. Do we think the elite leagues are really important? Absolutely. Are we investing there? Yes. But the thing that we think is going to have the most powerful impact on the world of competitive gaming is making everybody feel like theyâ€™re a star.At some point we realize that weâ€™re never going to play in the big leagues. That doesnâ€™t mean we canâ€™t play. We want to make sure that as the infancy of e-sports kind of grows and cultivates over time, that we donâ€™t lose all those other players, that players donâ€™t wake up one day and say, ""Well, Iâ€™m not going to be able to play in the big leagues in a big stadium, so Iâ€™m going to stop playing."" That would be really bad because then millions and millions and millions of people would lose out on the opportunity to compete, would lose out on the greatness, the thrill of victory, would lose out on what itâ€™s like to overcome the agony of defeat. We think thatâ€™s as much about what sport is as playing in the elite leagues. Weâ€™re investing as heavily there at a grassroots level as we are at the elite level.              You mentioned virtual reality earlier. I sense a reluctance from AAA publishers to appear bullish about VR. What is your best-case scenario for the future of virtual reality?Think about the Laserdisc and the DVD. You can see kind of a strand of DNA that went through those things, but it required a couple of turns of the innovation cycle to get to a point where we had truly amassed consumer-ready media. I think the same is going to be true for VR. For any consumer entertainment product to take off, it really needs three things. It needs to be innovative technology. VR has that. â€œYou just canâ€™t take FIFA from the PlayStation 4 straight into VR without making some fairly fundamental shifts.â€� What you then need is a profound user experience. You need the best games. You need the best experience with those games. Weâ€™re not there yet. The three biggest categories in games are action-adventure, shooters, and sports. All require you to run around in a virtual space. That, for many people inside VR, creates all kinds of nauseating symptoms. We, as designers and the hardware manufacturers, have to solve for that. Refresh rate and frame rate have to increase, the way we design games is going to have to change. You just canâ€™t take FIFA from the PlayStation 4 straight into VR without making some fairly fundamental shifts at a design level. Weâ€™ve got some work to do on the profound user experience.The last thing you need is low barrier to entry. For many people that means cost. Right now, all of the frontline VR opportunities, notwithstanding the Google option, which has a different challenge, but all the frontline things, theyâ€™re pretty expensive. When you think about what has happened in our space when one platform, whether itâ€™s Sony or Microsoft, launches at a more expensive price than the other, and you look at history, you see the cheaper one that was almost as good or equally as good usually won.Gamers are very price-sensitive. I think weâ€™ve got some turns of the cycle to happen to get a price point to a place where it becomes a no-brainer for people. Weâ€™ve got the innovative technology. Now we have work to do on the user proposition, and weâ€™ve got to bring the price down. I think all of those things are very doable, so Iâ€™m bullish on it. I really am.Earlier, you mentioned this group of millions of young white men playing games in their basement in the past. A lot of those people have grown up to become game developers, and created an industry largely of white men. Are there steps or opportunities in place now to improve diversity among the ranks of game makers â€” not just at the entry level â€” for the games of the future?There has to be. Diversity is such an important part of this. Again, if youâ€™re going to make games for a community, you have to have a true representation of that community. For the longest time our industry, like every other industry, was very white male-dominated. Weâ€™re seeing real change to that now. Some of our greatest creative leaders are women. I think two out of the three biggest games we launched last year were led by really strong, creative women.Weâ€™re seeing lots of people come out of very different backgrounds and very different communities. Part of the reason [our FIFA product] is so great and captures the essence of what football means or soccer means to people around the globe. We had 19 different nationalities on that team, all [of whom] loved soccer, but soccer meant something different to them if they come from Argentina versus Brazil, or if they come from the UK versus Germany, or France versus the US.Things mean different things to people from different places. That doesnâ€™t mean they love them any less. It just means they look at it through a different lens. We believe itâ€™s really important to capture that. I can tell you right now there is a very big push from us, whether itâ€™s to engage with girls who code to make sure weâ€™re getting 15-year-old girls into engineering. They love games, but have been scared off by this concept of engineering or computer engineering, which has been a white male-dominated world. Weâ€™re investing there. Weâ€™re investing in schools in different ethnic communities. Weâ€™re trying to recruit from around the globe, because again, what we have the opportunity to do is capture the true essence of a global community, of a global tribe inside of a virtual space. The only way we do that properly is to truly be representative of that community.This interview has been edited and condensed",2016.0,11.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,

",2016-11-15,"      The Verge 2021In celebration of our 5th anniversary, this month weâ€™re publishing a series of interviews with innovative leaders about what the next five years hold. To read more about this series, read our editor Nilay Patelâ€™s introduction here.By 2021, everyday software will be vastly more intelligent and powerful, replacing humans in more and more tasks. How will we keep up?While some predict mass unemployment or all-out war between humans and artificial intelligence, others foresee a less bleak future. Professor Manuela Veloso, head of the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, envisions a future in which humans and intelligent systems are inseparable, bound together in a continual exchange of information and goals that she calls â€œsymbiotic autonomy.â€� In Velosoâ€™s future, it will be hard to distinguish human agency from automated assistance â€” but neither people nor software will be much use without the other.Veloso is already testing out the idea on the CMU campus, building roving, segway-shaped robots called â€œcobotsâ€� to autonomously escort guests from building to building and ask for human help when they fall short. Itâ€™s a new way to think about artificial intelligence, and one that could have profound consequences in the next five years. We sat down with Veloso in Pittsburgh to talk about robots, programming spontaneity, and the challenge artificial intelligence poses for humanity. The InterviewOne of the big trends weâ€™ve seen over the last five years is automation. At the same time, weâ€™re also seeing more intelligence built into tools we already have, like phones and computers. Where do you see this process in five years?In the future, I believe that there will be a co-existence between humans and artificial intelligence systems that will be hopefully of service to humanity. These AI systems will involve software systems that handle the digital world, and also systems that move around in physical space, like drones, and robots, and autonomous cars, and also systems that process the physical space, like the Internet of Things.You will have more intelligent systems in the physical world, too â€” not just on your cell phone or computer, but physically present around us, processing and sensing information about the physical world and helping us with decisions that include knowing a lot about features of the physical world. As time goes by, weâ€™ll also see these AI systems having an impact on broader problems in society: managing traffic in a big city, for instance making complex predictions about the climate supporting humans in the big decisions they have to make.Right now, some of those systems can seem very ominous. When an algorithm or a robot makes a decision, we donâ€™t always know why it made that decision, which can make it hard to trust. How can technologists address that?One of the things Iâ€™m working on is that I would like these machines to be able to explain themselves â€” to be accountable for the decisions they make, to be transparent. A lot of the research we do is letting humans or users query the system. When Cobot, my robot, arrives to my office slightly late, I can say, ""Why are you late?"" or ""Which route did you take?""So we are working on the ability for these AI systems to explain themselves, while they learn, while they improve, in order to provide explanations with different levels of detail. We want to interact with these robots in ways that make us humans eventually trust AI systems more. You would like to be able to say, ""Why are you saying that?"" or ""Why are you recommending this?"" Providing that explanation is a lot of the research that I am doing now, and I believe robots being able to do that will lead to better understanding and trust in these AI systems. Eventually, through these interactions, humans are also going to be able to correct the AI systems. So weâ€™re also doing research trying to incorporate these corrections and have the systems learn from instruction. I think thatâ€™s a big part of our ability to coexist with these AI systems.             Why do you think these systems are improving so quickly now? What was holding us back over the last 50 years of AI research?You have to understand, for an AI system to know whatâ€™s a cell phone or whatâ€™s a cup or whether a person is healthy, you need knowledge. A lot of [AI] research in the early days was actually acquiring [that] knowledge. We would have to ask humans. We would have to go to books and manually enter that information into the computer. â€œIt seems that the world reveals itself on the internet.â€� Magically, in the last few years, more and more of this information is digital. It seems that the world reveals itself on the internet. So AI systems are now about the data thatâ€™s available and the ability to process that data and make sense of it, and weâ€™re still figuring out the best ways to do that. On the other hand, we are very optimistic because we know that the data is there.The question now becomes, how do we learn from it? How do you use it? How do you represent it? How do you study the distributions â€” the statistics of the data? How do you put all these pieces together? Thatâ€™s how you get deep learning and deep reinforcement learning and systems that do automatic translation and robots that play soccer. All these things are possible because we can process all this data so much more effectively and we donâ€™t have to take the enormous step of acquiring that knowledge and representing it. Itâ€™s there.One of the big developments of the last five years has been personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, which are both powered by machine learning. Iâ€™m curious how you see those systems changing over the next five years.You know, Iâ€™m a big fan of Alexa. I have one at home, and the amount of things I can talk with Alexa about have become broader. At the beginning it was just, ""Whatâ€™s the weather like?"" [Now] I can ask, ""What is on my calendar?"" Alexaâ€™s learning but Iâ€™m also learning what Alexa can do. Iâ€™m fascinated by how much better it becomes over time.Iâ€™ll tell you one thing that is interesting: when I leave the house, I tell Alexa, ""Alexa, stop."" I want to stop whatever music itâ€™s playing, because Iâ€™m leaving. But if I tell Alexa, ""Alexa, Iâ€™m leaving,"" it doesnâ€™t understand that ""Iâ€™m leaving"" means that it should stop. I have to explicitly say ""Stop."" So I would envision personal assistants becoming more aware of instructions like ""Alexa, when Iâ€™m leaving, that means that you should stop playing the music."" That kind of instructive command is going to be on the research agenda.    										Subscribe to our newsletter so you don't miss the rest of the Verge 2021 interviews.

Subscribe						Do you think weâ€™ll get to a point where we can ask personal assistants something like, ""Oh, the check engine light turned on in my car, should I take it in?"" Or ""Google, I just got this job offer, should I take it?""I think you might. These types of questions are decision-making questions â€” but suppose you had to decide between health insurance plans and you were confused about all the options. You might tell Alexa as you were going to sleep, ""Alexa, why donâ€™t you look at all these health insurance plans, or all these cars I can buy, or these schools my kid can go to,"" and it could compile a report for you overnight.   ""Why are you saying that I should buy that car?""    And a lot of the relevant information is already available online. You can find all the features of the schools, and reviews of the schools by other people. You have blogs about the schools or about other options. You could have an AI system that would gather all the features of these schools, how far they are, what other reviewers they have, [etc.]. You could enter a profile of what you would like from an education, and AI systems can put that information together. They can look at the features, they can learn from past experience, they can process all that information, massage everything thatâ€™s available and, with your guidance, with your questions, actually present that information in a way that may be easier for you to digest. Because the information [currently] online is overwhelming and sometimes you cannot handle all that information in real time.Eventually, you might also want to have the assistant tell you the reasons why it gave you those suggestions. You might ask, ""Why are you saying that I should buy that car? I really donâ€™t like that brand."" I think itâ€™s a very important step, having AI systems support humans in decision-making, trying to combine and learn from all the information and incorporate feedback you might give.What could those systems do beyond personal decisions?You could imagine a version of the same system working on scientific papers. There are so many scientific papers published, and now theyâ€™re all online. You can imagine an AI system that helps a researcher digest all that information and finds things that are related to their interests.The AI systems will still be a product of the information thatâ€™s online. A lot of people are working on information â€” text information, picture information, flow charts, tables â€” trying to understand whatâ€™s online and eventually infer needs from all that information. For example, thereâ€™s an area of machine learning called ""active learning"" in which we infer that there are not enough images of some process and you might want to add more images of that nature.I envision AI systems capable of identifying whatâ€™s missing, to connect the dots of all the information thatâ€™s online and request more data when itâ€™s necessary. You could imagine it asking researchers, ""If you just tell me more about how these cells will interact with this chemical, I would have a much better model of whatâ€™s happening.""             Part of that picture is your idea of symbiotic autonomy we see in the Cobots, right? Those robots are loose on the CMU campus right now, navigating through the computer science buildings with a combination of depth cameras, Wi-Fi, and LIDAR. They donâ€™t have arms so they have trouble with a lot of simple navigation tasks, but you made them very good at asking for help.Yes, it was kind of a discovery for us when we realized that these autonomous robots would have limitations. They would not be able to necessarily open all the doors of the world, they would not be able to understand all the spoken language. Maybe they will become better over time, but I do believe that in the same way that humans have limitations â€” I speak with an accent, I donâ€™t play squash as well as someone else â€” that these robots will also have limitations.   ""The robot proactively asks for help when there is something they canâ€™t do, they donâ€™t know, or they donâ€™t understand.""  It became clear for us that these robots, these AI systems, one of their main features would be to identify what they donâ€™t know, what they canâ€™t do, what they donâ€™t understand, and invoke help from humans. Can you push the elevator button? Can you open the door? Can you put something in my basket? This is what we call symbiotic autonomy. The robot proactively asks for help when there is something they canâ€™t do, they donâ€™t know, or they donâ€™t understand. Thatâ€™s a very new way of thinking, that we are going to have AI systems around us that are going to ask for our help for part of the tasks.As these systems scale up, that can happen in much more complex ways. Systems already communicate wirelessly, drawing on data in the cloud, or [are] helped by remote teams. You can think of AI systems in constant symbiosis with everything else, with other information on the web, with other AI systems, with humans next to them, with remote humans. It becomes not a problem of developing self-contained AI systems, but an AI system that can recognize when it does not know, or when it needs more information, or when it thinks something with some probability but itâ€™s not sure. Itâ€™s not that it can solve all the problems up front, but it can rely on all these other sources around it. Thatâ€™s how I envision it.How do you see that symbiosis changing the AI systems we already use?So letâ€™s go back to the scenario of asking an AI for help with decisions about the school or decisions about what health insurance to take. I imagine these AI systems might at some point need information that the human did not provide. The AI system might realize that if I had just known this additional feature, it might help in giving you a better decision.  ""Whatâ€™s really interesting is when AI systems can recognize what theyâ€™re missing.""  Whatâ€™s really interesting is when AI systems can recognize what theyâ€™re missing by themselves. They recognize that if they just had more information, if they were able to do some specific action â€” for instance, if they could just reserve a room in that hotel thatâ€™s not bookable online, they could get you a hotel closer to your conference. I really think that ability is whatâ€™s important, because Iâ€™m not going to know all the things that the system needs to make a decision.Currently we enter an address for the destination on Uber or Google Maps or Waze, and thatâ€™s enough for the route to be planned. However, Waze could come back to you and ask, ""Are you in a hurry? Am I supposed to get you the shortest path? Would you like to just take a divergence and see that beautiful scenery there?"" What if the assistant knows that I really love orchids, or that I really love some type of art? If I had just diverged slightly, I could have visited this great museum. It does not know that in its route planning. If it knew that, it would have routed me through that museum path.                      A lot of our current AI systems are specialized in specific tasks like recognizing objects or optimizing routes â€” but thatâ€™s resulted in a very siloed kind of expertise. Iâ€™m curious what you think is holding us back from a kind of more generalizable intelligence in software.    The General AI problem is extremely challenging. I do think that we have techniques now â€” deep learning, deep reinforcement learning â€” that have a flavor of general intelligence. We are also doing a lot of research on trying to understand this concept of transfer learning. How do we have algorithms that, because they can address one particular task, also learn to do something else? We are not done with understanding AI. We donâ€™t know how to do many things. We are still really in the infancy of AI in terms of algorithms and techniques, methods of making generalizations, methods of providing explanations, weâ€™re still waving our hands about a lot of these things.  ""We are still really in the infancy of AI... weâ€™re still waving our hands about a lot of these things.""  I do think General AI could one day come out of an integration between specialized AI systems, merging them into this Society of Mind that Minsky described. And you could have special-purpose algorithms that solve problems of great complexity, as Herb Simon and Allen Newell predicted in the beginnings of AI research.So the research on general AI is extremely challenging, but itâ€™s also extremely exciting now because thereâ€™s so much data. There are just so many people using digital devices and generating data. More and more, by using computers and cell phones and Alexa and Uber, all of these put us on a very good path to do research on these general AI problems. We still have a lot of research to do. We still donâ€™t know exactly what a general AI system will be, but we are on a good path.            Does that uncertainty ever worry you? Some worry that as soon as artificial intelligence outpaces human intelligence, humanity will be doomed.I am a complete optimist. I think that the research weâ€™re doing on autonomous systems â€” autonomous cars, autonomous robots â€” itâ€™s a call to humanity to be responsible. In some sense, it has nothing to do with the technology. The technology will be developed. It was invented by us â€” by humans. It didnâ€™t come from the sky from aliens. Itâ€™s our own discovery. Itâ€™s the human mind that conceived such technology, and itâ€™s up to the human mind also to make good use of it.          I have a lot of trust that this will happen. Iâ€™m very optimistic because I really think that humanity is aware that they need to handle this technology carefully. And I am aware, too. But the best thing to do is invest in education. Leave the robots alone. The robots will keep getting better, but focus on education, people knowing each other, caring for each other. Caring for the advancement of society. Caring for the advancement of Earth, of nature, improving science. Solve all these problems. Cure cancer. End poverty. There are so many things we can get involved in as humankind that could make good use of this technology weâ€™re developing.In some sense, the humanism of AI will eventually be what brings us together. So, Iâ€™m optimistic.This interview has been edited and condensed",2016.0,11.0,Verge,Longform,1.0,,
21,Delivery drones will mean the end of ownership,"
Lauren Goode
",2016-11-08,"      The Verge 2021In celebration of our 5th anniversary, this month weâ€™re publishing a series of interviews with innovative leaders about what the next five years hold. To read more about this series, read our editor Nilay Patelâ€™s introduction here.Few subsidiaries at Alphabet Inc. inspire as much curiosity as Google X, now called simply â€œX.â€� X is the companyâ€™s innovation lab, where ambitious but far-fetched tech ideas are pitched, tested, and either come to life or are ultimately killed. Itâ€™s where Googleâ€™s self-driving car concept was developed, where giant internet access balloons were conceived, where glucose-monitoring contact lenses were first experimented with, and where burrito-delivering drones are part of a beta test for bigger things. And while more than 250 employees are behind these far-fetched projects, for the past five years the face of X has been Astro Teller, the so-called â€œCaptain of Moonshots.â€� Teller has the CV of a mad scientist: he has degrees in computer science, symbolic and heuristic computation, and a PhD in artificial intelligence from Carnegie Mellon University. After his time in academia, he founded health-tracking company Body Media (acquired by Jawbone) before joining Google X. With his goatee, ponytail, and the Rollerblades he wears everywhere, all day, Teller has become one of Googleâ€™s most recognizable characters. He is a published author of both fiction and nonfiction books he gives TED Talks. But for someone so heavily involved in futuristic projects, Teller stubbornly refuses to predict the future. For him, X is not a lab that churns out immediately useable technology or marketable products, but a place where innovation is â€œsystemizedâ€� â€” imagine Henry Fordâ€™s assembly line, but for ideas. Heâ€™s less inclined to prognosticate about solutions than he is to talk about the problems that will need to be addressed in the future â€” whether itâ€™s the â€œmeta problemâ€� of climate change the threats and promises of artificial intelligence or just how, exactly, societyâ€™s acceptance of new technology will match the rapid pace of innovation.  The InterviewWhat does a day look like five to 10 years from now?The real answer is I donâ€™t know, and much more importantly, I donâ€™t think anyone knows. Trying to prognosticate is a very dangerous business. Itâ€™s good for people who are on the speaking circuit, but there isnâ€™t any evidence that anyone is any good at it.      The way I would like to function, the way I think most of us here at X function, is to focus instead on asking the questions for the kinds of futures that we imagine might be possible. How fast can we discover that weâ€™re wrong, get rid of those ideas or evolve them from where they currently are, to correctly pointed ideas?Youâ€™ve been quoted as saying that your team doesnâ€™t fall in love with solutions, you fall in love with problems. Five to 10 years from now, what are our biggest problems?Iâ€™m a big believer in falling in love with the problems, not falling in love with the technologies. But falling in love with the problem doesnâ€™t always teach you exactly what to do.For example, you could observe that starting around 10,000 years ago humanity stopped primarily hunting for meat. We started domesticating animals instead. Yet we still get more than half of the fish that we eat in the world by hunting it. Thatâ€™s just weird. Surely that wonâ€™t stay the way it currently is. In the future we will surely be farming in the sea and not just the standard fish farming that happens on shore and very near to the shore.     Climate change is a huge problem, almost a meta problem. It has a set of problems within it. Just because weâ€™ve identified a problem, that means itâ€™s on our radar screen. It doesnâ€™t mean that weâ€™ve found a solution to it yet or even working on the solution yet.										Subscribe to our newsletter so you don't miss the rest of the Verge 2021 interviews.

Subscribe						Letâ€™s talk a little bit about the fear of change â€” how do you prepare society at large for radically new technologies?Historically, changes in our society, particularly those driven by technology, used to take a long time. One thousand years ago, when somebody came up with a new technology the time between when the technology was invented and when it was widespread in the worldâ€¦ was huge.That gave us several generations during which people could come to terms with how society was being changed by that technology. One hundred years ago when the steam engine was introduced or the telegraph or the telephone, [and] somewhat later the television, those things spread through humanity much faster. They spread maybe on the order of 10 to 20 years. â€œThe time between when a new technology is introduced and when itâ€™s completely changed the world has continued to shrink.â€� Fast-forward to today, the time between when a new technology is introduced and when itâ€™s completely changed the world has continued to shrink at a fast rate. Itâ€™s now probably five to seven years between when a new technology is introduced and when it really has changed society in a fundamental way. If the world is now changing faster than we can accommodate, it causes a huge incremental level of anxiety for society at large. That is our challenge.    What can be done about that? We can point to specific parts of society which we know we could make better. The patent system was built 130â€“140 years ago around the idea that you would be granted a temporary monopoly for your idea, it would last about 20 years and you would harvest a lot of value during that time. Then it would be free to everybody afterwards.Today thatâ€™s still true. Itâ€™s still a 20-year license that youâ€™re getting. [But] now technology is changing so fast, by the time you get the patent itâ€™s often not worth that much anymore because [itâ€™s] old newsâ€¦The way we make laws and regulate technology is another good example where the pace at which we understand the technology and then build laws around that technology is now going sufficiently slower than the technology itself.We need to fix that. We need to go faster on those fronts.                Whose responsibility is it to mitigate some of that anxiety around technology? The technologists? The regulators? Or is society supposed to adapt more quickly?I think that the onus for how we help society to adjust to new technologies falls on all of us. Does it fall on technologists? Absolutely. Technologists should be making responsible technologies. They should be working hard to educate the world about the ramifications of the technologies such as they can foresee them. That doesnâ€™t mean no one else has any responsibility.    The rate at which society copes with new technologies and their ramifications for society is partly rate limited by how we educate both the young people and adults in this country. If technology is continuing to change faster and faster and we donâ€™t get better and better at educating our children to adapt to these changes, then we, the public sector and the education system, are failing our children.I donâ€™t mean to suggest that technologists donâ€™t have a role to play in how society adapts to new technologies, but certainly other aspects of society also have to pitch in so that society can really elegantly and smoothly keep pace with the technology changes that are happening.Youâ€™re part of a group called AI100 thatâ€™s doing a very long-term study on the impact of artificial intelligence. The researchers involved have said they donâ€™t consider it likely that, in the near term, AI systems will autonomously choose to inflict harm on people. But they also noted that it is possible for people to use AI systems for harmful â€” as well as helpful â€” purposes. How do you see AI impacting society?Artificial intelligence is going to turn out, I predict â€” itâ€™s a dangerous thing as Iâ€™ve said to try to predict the future â€”  [to be] technology that profoundly changes the world. We will come to see [it] the way we see electricity. It will be in everything. It will power almost everything, but we will rarely stop to think about it in very much the way that electricity has changed so much of our lives and yet we now take so much for granted. â€œIâ€™m sure there will be abuses of artificial intelligence in some ways.â€� Iâ€™m sure there will be abuses of artificial intelligence in some ways. Iâ€™m also confident that on balance, like electricity, artificial intelligence will be a lever for the human mind. It will make it so that the things around us make our lives better. Thereâ€™s no strong evidence that Iâ€™ve seen that that wonâ€™t be the future that we end up in.Cyber security is one of the worldâ€™s big problems. Surely the bad guys in the cyber security world will use smart interesting ways of counting, [or] artificial intelligence by another name, to enable them to do bad things. Society probably has two choices. We can just let them get the upper hand, or we can have artificial intelligence participate in protecting us. I think that microcosm is a useful way for us to think about what our choice is in society. The hackers are going to do it either way. Do we want to get our software system smarter and smarter about protecting us or not?I think a lot of people have a vision of the future in which they wake up in the morning and shout to their virtual assistant to perform tasks for them â€” we already do this. Then a robot will drive them to work and fold their laundry at home at night. But the tradeoff is that we have to give up an immense amount of personal data in order to enable this. That makes some people very wary. Do you think this will still be an issue in the future?I think that people will have a pretty wide spectrum of how much data they feel comfortable sharing, but I think itâ€™s fair to say that even wealthy people who can afford a personal [human] assistant have a pretty wide spectrum on the kinds of stuff that they will share with their assistants. Some will tell their assistants everything, will give them the codes to their bank account and ask them to do a lot of things that other people are uncomfortable having a human assistant do.If you donâ€™t want to share your data, you shouldnâ€™t have to share your data with a digital assistant. Simultaneously, I donâ€™t think anyone should be made to feel bad if they want the benefits they can get from a digital assistant. Of course, the only way to get those benefits is for the digital assistant to have enough data to be able to help them. I would certainly hope that the future encompasses both of those perspectives and allows for both of those kinds of people to get what they want.                What does the job market look like once AI has started to displace some of the tasks that humans currently handle?Technology has been displacing and creating jobs since there was technology. The lever, one of the first technologies that was ever created, allows one person to lift up something that before would have taken many people to lift up. That caused some people, from a narrow perspective, to lose their jobs. â€œArtificial intelligence is likely to cause some jobs to go away.â€� It turns out that that hasnâ€™t actually caused people to lose their jobs because people spend their time making levers and because it turned out that instead of one person moving the boulder that used to cost you 10 peopleâ€¦ you would use that one person to move that one boulder [and] you have nine other people moving their own boulders. You now move 10 times as many boulders.In other words, artificial intelligence is likely to cause some jobs to go away and is going to create a ton of new opportunity. In order to believe that all jobs are going to go away, which is a rather extreme view, but certainly one that some people are saying, I think you would have to believe that thereâ€™s an end to the problems in the world. That the problems are going to get all used up, taken up. That artificial intelligence will be so good we will run out of problems. I donâ€™t believe that thatâ€™s going to happen.It is a failure of imagination on our collective parts that we canâ€™t see how, when robots take [over] some of what weâ€™re currently doing, it wonâ€™t just level us up to the next level.Project Wing, which is Xâ€™s drone project, recently tested food delivery by drone. Have you had a burrito delivered to you by drone?I have.How was it?It was great. It was actually slightly magical. I think people over-focus on drones plus burritos. I guess I understand why they can over-fixate on that, but hereâ€™s how I would describe it.Every time we have, as a society, as a species, removed another big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the physical world â€” boats, planes, trains, horses and the pony express, the mail system â€” [we have] profoundly changed society. Itâ€™s easy for us to see those things looking backwards because weâ€™ve become used to not having the frictions that have been removed. We would never go back, but weâ€™re very used to the remaining friction and how physical things are moved around in the physical world. â€œYou probably have a power drill. You use it one-10,000th of the time, maybe one-100,000th of the time.â€� [Letâ€™s say] you could just snap your fingers and have something magically appear in your hand whenever you wanted it [at] no cost, and it was instantaneous. You have a hammer in your home. You probably have a power drill. You use it one-10,000th of the time, maybe one-100,000th of the time. If that hammer was sitting in some central location, it could be shared by thousands of people, really safely, making everybody wealthier functionally because they would get the hammer when they need it without having to pay for the hammer and drain the worldâ€™s resources by making all of these hammers that go almost entirely unused.You have a drawer full of batteries right now in your home, I guarantee you, that are discharging very slowly. Maybe you have a little ziplock bag full of them, because you never know for sure when youâ€™re going to need one and what shape itâ€™s going to need to be.Because you donâ€™t know and because itâ€™s surprisingly inconvenient to go to CVS or Walgreens to get another battery, you just keep all of these batteries in your home that are slowly discharging, most of which will hit zero without you ever using them. Youâ€™re wasting the planet in a really dramatic way and the reason youâ€™re doing it is because you canâ€™t just snap your fingers and have that battery appear.If we could move from an ownership society to an access society where having it now wasnâ€™t importantâ€¦ [but] having it when you need it, it would really dramatically, magically, change the world.                        So in the future, drones will be flying through the air overhead. We wonâ€™t own as many things because weâ€™ll be sharing them. Unmanned aerial vehicles will essentially power the sharing economy and reduce our carbon footprint â€” all of this great stuff. What is the biggest challenge to achieving that right now?I donâ€™t want to minimize the challenges for the Wing project. We need to make things that can successful move long distances completely autonomously with very high levels of safety and reasonably inexpensively. That is not a solved problem.You want to make sure that you donâ€™t hit a power line, that if something goes wrong with one of your motors, that you can land elegantly instead of just crashing out of the sky. That when you get where youâ€™re going, the system can cope thoughtfully with where to put the package down and possibly taking a package back or something else.There are a lot of as yet unsolved problems. â€œIâ€™ve actually already seen designs for skyscrapers that have little mini-heliports sticking outside the window.â€� Will residences in the future be designed with drone launch pads and landing pads? Will this actually factor into our design and the way we live?Iâ€™ve actually already seen designs for skyscrapers that have little mini-heliports sticking outside the window so that UAVs can drop packages on peopleâ€™s windows in high-rises or just outside their windows or maybe land and then someone can take the package right there. Iâ€™ve seen those designs, thatâ€™s something that weâ€™re working on. I think itâ€™s maybe a little premature to be building buildings like that, but good for them for starting to imagine them.With Project Loon, X is trying to solve problems around internet access, both for the underserved and for people in the developed world who have internet access but want to fill in the gaps. Do you see any potential downside to constant connectivity?I sometimes wish my kids would get off their phones, but [Iâ€™m not] one of the people who believes that society is being damaged by constant connectivity. I happen, actually, not to be a heavy user of social media. Maybe Iâ€™m just missing the addiction, so it doesnâ€™t seem that bad to me, but I believe that this is not the first time that people have panicked that technology or other kinds of innovations in society were going to ruin society.Rock n roll was heavily billed as destroying the youth of America and somehow the youth of America have survived rock n roll. I rather suspect they will survive Facebook as well.            What is the thing or the project that X is doing right now [that] you think will have the most impact on society in five to 10 years?Iâ€™m not going to pick the favorite of my children. Thatâ€™s not a winning proposition. But Iâ€™m going to give you my honest answer.I hope that in the end, when we look back at X 10 years from now, 20 years from now, the process that Iâ€™ve described to you our attempt to systematize innovation, to get that balance of crazy optimism and really hard skepticism, married together and balanced [will be] just right.If we can get that right enough and demonstrate enough times that we have at least somewhat systematized innovation, Iâ€™m hopeful that that will turn out to be the thing that has the biggest impact rather than any one of the projects that comes out of X.So itâ€™s Xâ€™s process, rather than a specific product.What Iâ€™m saying is, what do you think had a bigger impact on the world? Henry Fordâ€™s observation about how to make stuff, or the Model T? I believe that Henry Fordâ€™s bigger impact on the world was the systematization of interchangeable parts in a factory setting. That was even bigger than some of the car-specific stuff that the factory built.In the same way, while Iâ€™m very proud of some of the things that have already graduated from X â€” the self-driving cars, the life sciences project, the deep learning work called Google Brain that went back to Google. Iâ€™m very proud of a lot of the things that are currently being brewed here, I am hopeful that in the end the thing thatâ€¦ will have created the most value is the way weâ€™re making them.Will X be around in five to 10 years?I donâ€™t know, but youâ€™re welcome to come back in five to 10 years and ask.Will X last as long as Ford has? Fordâ€™s been around for a long time.X is certainly intended to go on into the future. Whether it does or not weâ€™ll have to wait and see.
